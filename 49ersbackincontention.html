					<p>The San Francisco 49ers looked to be the latest team suffering from a Super Bowl hangover following a tough 2 - 3 start in which they lost key players due to injury, and had a couple of big losses including a 43 - 17 blowout by the Miami Dolphins. Sunday night's game against division rivals the Los Angeles Rams really seemed like a must win, given that a loss would put them over 3 games behind the Rams and Seahawks in the division. The 49ers were big underdogs coming in, mainly because of their poor performance in Week 5, and the fact that they were up against a 4 - 1 team.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>With a virtually fully healthy offense though, San Fran had things clicking from the start. The run game looked as good if not better than last season with Raheem Mostert charging through the Rams defense on multiple occasions, and Deebo Samuel up to his usual tricks on jet sweeps. Jimmy G's second game back from injury was much more productive than the first, as the former Patriot went 23/33 for 268 yards and 3 TDs, noting that he was able to do a lot more with his feet than last week with the high ankle sprain fully healed. After a couple of disappointing losses, the 49ers looked like the team that made it to the Super Bowl last year, but in a highly competitive division, is there a way back for San Francisco in 2020?</p>
				</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Despite the fact that they are currently at .500 with a 3 - 3 record, the 49ers find themselves bottom of the NFC West, with the Rams (4 - 2), Cardinals (4 - 2), and Seahawks (5 - 0) all ahead of them. It is undoubtedly the toughest division in the NFL, and the 49ers are unlucky that a 3 - 3 record would see them have a comfortable lead if they were in the NFC East. Realistically though, the NFC West is probably out of reach for this 49ers team, with 3 very good teams ahead of them, but with the new playoff format of 7 teams from each conference advancing to the postseason, they do have a shot at still being able to play football in January.</p>

					<p>Even with the extra playoff spot, the 49ers have a very difficult path to the postseason, considering how unforgiving the remainder of their schedule is:</p>

					<p>7 of their remaining 10 games are against teams who are currently better than .500, and in their next 4 games they will face Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers, and Drew Brees, which is an incredibly tough ask for a banged up defense. So it could be hard for the 49ers to build any real momentum in October and November, which is critical because if they have a losing record entering the final month, then their playoff chances are effectively over with a 9 - 7 record or above probably needed to clinch a postseason berth in this stacked NFC.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It can only take a couple of games for things to turn around completely though, and Sunday's win against the Rams was definitely a starting point. With a very tough schedule ahead though, they will have to play as well, if not better than they did last season, which could be difficult given that their defense won't be able to dominate a lot of games with multiple starters sidelined due to injury. There is a road back for San Francisco, but it is far from an easy one, and they have already lost as many games in 2020 as they did all of last year (not counting postseason). Let's hope it comes down to inches again in Week 17 vs. Seattle.</p>
