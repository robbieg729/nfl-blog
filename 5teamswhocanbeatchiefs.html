					<p>Coming into Week 14, the Kansas City Chiefs were on a roll with 7 consecutive wins, and looked outright unstoppable virtually every week. Patrick Mahomes was unquestionably ahead in the MVP race with 5 straight games of 315+ pass yards, and 15 TDs to just 1 INT over that stretch. Sunday's game against the Dolphins in Miami however may have revealed that the Chiefs are indeed beatable. Despite a 33 - 27 win that looked headed for a blowout in the third quarter, Mahomes threw 3 picks, something he has only done once before in his career (2018 Week 11 at the Rams).</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It was the second straight multi-interception game for Mahomes at Hard Rock Stadium, the previous one being Super Bowl LIV, in which he was named MVP. A shaky performance from Mahomes and the Chiefs, especially in the first and fourth quarters, has brought up concerns that this will not be a slam dunk repeat as the past few weeks may have suggested. In order to beat them however, your team has to have at least one of two things: an offense that can keep up with them, and a defense that can force turnovers off Mahomes. There are not a lot of teams that fill this criteria, but here are the 5 teams I think have the best shot at defeating the reigning champs en route to Super Bowl LV in Tampa.</p>

			  	</div>
	  		</div>		  
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Kansas City played Buffalo earlier in the season on a rainy Monday night, and virtually outplayed them in all phases of the game. The Bills are a much better football team right now though, and have a lot of confidence heading into the final weeks of the regular season after handing the Pittsburgh Steelers their second straight loss. The defense has improved significantly over the last few weeks, and Josh Allen is finding his stride again after a couple of shaky games in the middle of the season. His chemistry with Diggs is one of the top 5 in the league without a doubt, as the former Vikings WR became the first player in 2020 to hit 100 receptions on Sunday night.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The offense is certainly capable of putting up a ton of points and have other studs like Cole Beasley and John Brown, however there is one weakness for the Bills that may haunt them if they face Kansas City in the playoffs. The run game has just not been productive for the Bills this season, averaging just 102.5 YPG (22nd in NFL), and that is something that can really work against you because a good running game makes it easy to keep the clock running, which keeps the Chiefs offense off the field for an extended period of time. Make no mistake though, this Bills team can win in a shootout, and already have done this season against both the Rams and Seahawks.</p>

			  	</div>
	  		</div>		  
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Indianapolis Colts may not currently be top of their division, but they have a team that is built to beat the Chiefs. They have one of the best defenses in the league that includes studs like Deforest Buckner, Xavier Rhodes, and Darius Leonard, and unlike the Bills, have a productive and efficient 3-pronged rushing attack that can be devastating behind what is such a good offensive line. Philip Rivers has really come into his own recently too and is one of the hottest QBs in the league right now, with 100+ passer ratings in 4 of his last 5 games. The Colts are also an extremely well coached team, led by Frank Reich, who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles back in 2017. Even though this team is currently just the #6 seed in the AFC, I believe they are one of just two teams in the conference who can stop the Chiefs from reaching a second straight Super Bowl, and probably have a better chance than Buffalo of doing so, simply because they have everything you need to beat Kansas City.</p>

			  	</div>
	  		</div>		  
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Packers do not have enough defensively to stop the Chiefs from scoring 30+ points, but let's be honest they don't need to do that with the way Aaron Rodgers is playing right now. The two-time, and possibly three-time MVP has led Green Bay to 10 games of scoring 30+ points, and 3 of scoring 40+ so far in 2020, and is showing no signs of slowing down with a league leading 39 pass TDs and 4 INTs. With him in this kind of form, the Packers can keep up with anybody and are probably the favorites to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl after they took the #1 seed away from the Saints on Sunday. Additionally, even though Green Bay's defense is not one of the best in the league, it is a defense that has some good playmakers like the Smith brothers and Jaire Alexander, so they can step up when they need to.</p>

			  	</div>
	  		</div>		  
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>New Orleans has suffered from some terrible playoff heartbreak in the last three years, from the Minneapolis Miracle to one of the worst non-calls in NFL history, but this could absolutely be the year they make the Super Bowl and go head-to-head against Kansas City. As previously mentioned, a productive ground game can be key to beating the Chiefs because it eats up more clock. The Saints not only have a good rushing attack, but the fact that Drew Brees is often so accurate also means that the passing game can take up a lot of game clock too.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Not to mention, the Saints have arguably the best defense in the league and will probably completely eliminate any kind of rushing attack that the Chiefs try to get going should they meet, forcing Mahomes to throw the ball into their excellent secondary. New Orleans is a very well-coached football team, and the football gods may just smile down on them this season after delivering some cruel blows in years past. It should be noted that the two teams face off this week, although this likely will be a very different game with Drew Brees not playing, and the Chiefs will probably win.</p>

			  	</div>
	  		</div>		  
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Rams and Chiefs have not met since that 54 - 51 instant classic back in 2018 when LA emerged victorious, so a Super Bowl between these two franchises could be epic. Like the Colts, the Rams also have all the ingredients to beat the Chiefs. They have an excellent D-line, headed by Aaron Donald, that can wreak havoc on opposing teams, they have some outstanding cornerbacks including Jalen Ramsey, and their offense is one of the most well-run offenses in the league. I mentioned eating the clock being useful against Kansas City, but the up-tempo offense that the Rams run is effective in a different way, in that it can really put the defense on it's heels, and can get them a quick score should they find themselves losing by a couple touchdowns.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The ground game has also been a factor for the Rams recently though, with rookie Cam Akers quickly becoming the bellcow back in Los Angeles after a 171 yard game against the Patriots in Week 14. This team really does have the full package, and a Super Bowl between them and the Chiefs would be a fantastic watch, because it would just be 4 hours of two incredibly innovate and inventive offenses trying to outduel each other.</p>
