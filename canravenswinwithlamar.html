				<div class="col">
					<p>Lamar Jackson is only 23 years old, but he has already received certain accolades that most people of a similar age can only dream of. He won the Heisman Trophy in 2016, was a first-round draft pick at #32 in the 2018 NFL draft, and was named NFL MVP in just his second season in pro football, after his astonishing stat line of 36 passing TDs with just 6 INTs, and an all-time single season QB record of 1206 rush yards. There's no doubt that this guy is one of the best athletes in the NFL, and yet there's still some concern about whether or not he can deliver a third Super Bowl championship to the Ravens franchise.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>On Sunday, Jackson and his Baltimore team fell to their second defeat of the 2020 season, losing 28 - 24 at home in a tightly contested game versus the now 7 - 0 Pittsburgh Steelers. That puts the Ravens at 5 - 2, which means they have already lost as many games this season as they did all of last year (not counting playoffs). A 5 - 2 record is still respectable though, and there's no shame in losing to the last undefeated team in the league right? Well no there isn't, but it wasn't so much that they lost, it was the manner in which they lost which was concerning.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Almost everything that needed to happen for the Ravens to win against the Steelers did indeed happen, and yet they still couldn't win. They were able to rush for 265 yards against the league's best run defense. Their defense forced turnovers, got sacks, and in general made it very difficult for the Steelers to move the ball up the field. They even had a 10 point lead at halftime, which of course suits Lamar Jackson because he's usually very good with a lead. But they still couldn't get it done. Why? Lamar Jackson.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The reigning league MVP made a lot of mistakes on Sunday, including 2 lost fumbles and 2 INTs, one of which was returned for a touchdown early in the game. Yes the Steelers have a very good defense, but in this league you have to be able to play well against good teams in order to make it to the playoffs and to the Super Bowl. The Ravens have 5 wins this season against the Browns, Texans, Football Team, Bengals, and Eagles, none of which are very good football teams. Meanwhile their 2 losses have come against the Chiefs and the Steelers who have a combined record of 14 - 1. It's not just this season that this happens either - not playing well against good teams has been a recurring theme throughout Lamar's young career in the NFL.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Jackson has played 31 games in his pro career, and has had 6 really big matchups - 2 playoff games (versus the Chargers and the Titans), 3 games against the Chiefs, and now Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Guess how many Lamar has won? Yep, 0. 0 - 6 in the biggest games of his career, and 24 - 1 in the rest. In those 6 games he has not played particularly well either, especially in the 2 playoff games and the most recent one against the Steelers. The reality is, Lamar Jackson is not a good QB. He's a phenomenal athlete, but he's not a good QB. He's often mentioned in the same category as Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes but it's clearer than ever that those two are way ahead of Lamar.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>One of the biggest problems with Jackson is his accuracy throwing the football. He's never been a great thrower of the football, and has a career completion percentage of just 62.9%. Compared to Wilson (64.9%) and Mahomes (66.1%) that's a lot less accurate, and accuracy really is the most important thing for a QB not just in the NFL but at any level. You can run around with the football in your hand all you want but there comes a point where you're going to have to throw the football. It could be fourth and long in a playoff game and you're down 6 with 1 minute to go and if you can't find your guy consistently, it's hard to win rings.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>That's why I think it still could be a while before the Ravens win a third Super Bowl ring. Jackson was absolutely deserving of his MVP award last season, but there are a lot of QBs in this league that are better than him, and some emerging stars like Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert that look more like the future than Jackson does. Obviously it's not always about who has the better QB, and the Ravens have an exceptional defense, but big games like playoff matchups and Super Bowls often come down to a certain QB making a big time throw, and that's something Lamar hasn't really done in his career thus far.</p>
