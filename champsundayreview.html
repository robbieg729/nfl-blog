					<p>A thrilling Championship Sunday has given us a Mahomes-Brady Super Bowl in what could be the last meeting between 2 of the best QBs to ever do it, with their head-to-head record currently at 2 - 2. While there was jubilation and ecstasy for Bucs and Chiefs fans yesterday however, Packers and Bills fans were unfortunately unable to celebrate a victory, as their seasons ended just short of a trip to Super Bowl LV in Tampa on February 7. What went wrong for Green Bay and Buffalo in their losses?</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Aaron Rodgers is now 1 - 4 in NFC Championship Games after yesterday's close defeat, but it's hard to put this one on him. The likely MVP actually had a better game than Tom Brady, against a better defense too, as he posted 33/48 for 346 yards, 3 TDs, and 1 INT. He was not a reason his team lost this game, but there are quite a few. The first was their 3rd down defense. Early on in the game, Green Bay allowed far too many 3rd downs to be converted, particularly 3rd and 7+, which allowed the Bucs offense to gain a foothold. In total, they allowed 64% of Tampa Bay's 3rd downs to be converted, after allowing only 39.5% in the regular season.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another reason the Packers lost was Kevin King. He simply had an awful game, getting beat on the opening TD by Mike Evans, and getting burned by Scotty Miller for the shocking last-second TD at the end of the first half. In fairness to him on that play, it was a terrible play-call by the defensive coordinator, Mike Pettine. With the Bucs at the 39 yard line, with 8 seconds left and no timeouts, Pettine decided to play man coverage instead of playing zone prevent defense, which would have virtually guaranteed the Bucs wouldn't have scored a TD. And that wasn't the only bad play-call by the Packers in the game.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The decision to kick a field goal on 4th and goal instead of going for a TD down 8 with just over 2 minutes left was definitely a head-scratcher, especially when you have Aaron Rodgers at QB. Rodgers did not seem happy about it in a postgame press conference, and I don't think many Packers fans were too thrilled either. The former Super Bowl MVP even expressed concerns about whether he would even be back in Green Bay next season, which would be a shame because he and head coach Matt LaFleur had something really good going until that decision to go for 3 points instead of a potential game-tying TD.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Packers also gave up 5 sacks yesterday, after giving up none in last week's game against a very good Rams defensive front, and it was clear that they missed their excellent left tackle David Bakhtiari, as his replacement, Billy Turner, was allowing Shaq Barrett to get so much pressure on Rodgers. At the end of the day though, I think it is the coaching staff who will look back at this game with a lot of regrets and what ifs, because most of the blame for the loss should fall to them.</p>

			  	</div>	
		    </div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This was also a bit of a dodgy coaching performance by Sean McDermott, who had really been excellent with his play-calling and decision making all season long. The main problem for the Bills was that they just couldn't find the endzone when they got inside the 20, which incidentally, was the worst area of the field for the Chiefs defense all season (allowed highest percentage of TDs on redzone drives in the league).</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>One reason they didn't find the endzone often was because they kept kicking field goals, which was a really weird thing to see McDermott do. Buffalo had a couple of 4th and shorts inside the Chiefs 20 yard line and strangely elected not to leave the offense on the field. If there's one thing we've learned over the past 3 seasons it's that you can't beat the Chiefs with field goals, but last night, McDermott seemed to think his team could even though his defense was doing nothing to stop Kansas City's offense from reaching the endzone.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Josh Allen played pretty poorly too, considering how well he had played during the regular season. He took way too many sacks, including a lot of big ones, and he and Diggs just struggled to link up. They also found it hard to convert 3rd downs, gaining an extra set just 35% of the time, and that is something that has actually been a problem for them throughout the course of these playoffs (converted just 30.6% of 3rd downs).</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>All things considered, it has been a fantastic season for Buffalo, but I just feel like last night was a great opportunity for them to reach a Super Bowl with Mahomes clearly not 100%. Unfortunately though, they struggled in a lot of areas, as they allowed the Chiefs to go on a 38 - 6 run after initially being up 9 - 0. They'll be back next season, but they may now have to contend with Deshaun Watson in the division, with rumors of him potentially lining up a move to the Jets.</p>
