					<p>The 2020 NFL playoffs kicked off last weekend with a thrilling Wild Card round that saw road teams go 4 - 2, with no 3 or 4 seeds in either conference being able to handle business. The postseason continues this week with 4 more games on Divisional Weekend, as the top seeds in each conference, the Chiefs and Packers, begin their quest for another Lombardi Trophy. This weekend also sees the third meeting of the season between the all-time leaders in passing yards and passing TDs, Tom Brady and Drew Brees, with the latter taking home the spoils in both of the previous 2 contests. Here is a short preview of each game, and who will likely move on to the final four.</p>

						<th><img src="images/Rams2.png"></th>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The #1 scoring offense against the #1 scoring defense is how Divisional Weekend begins. Although it may seem like a tough matchup for Green Bay, especially given how the Rams demolished Russ and the Seahawks last week, there are a lot of reasons why the Packers are heavily favored to beat Los Angeles and advance. The Rams may have sacked Russell Wilson 5 times for 32 yards last week, but that was against a Seattle offensive line that is sixth-worst in both allowing sacks and allowing QB hits. The Packers O-line, meanwhile is second-best in allowing sacks and best in allowing QB hits, and includes 2 Pro Bowlers. Granted, Green Bay will be without one of their Pro Bowl linemen in David Bakhtiari, but even those that aren't Pro Bowlers are still very good and have given Aaron Rodgers all day in the pocket all season long.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another key matchup that many are looking forward to is Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey vs. Packers receiver Davante Adams, both Pro Bowlers and both arguably the best at their position. Per Pro Football Focus (PFF), the only receiver to have 50+ receiving yards while being guarded by Ramsey this season was Amari Cooper way back in Week 1. However, out of all the receivers Ramsey has faced this season, and that includes Deandre Hopkins and Stefon Diggs, Adams is easily the best route runner, and with the connection between Rodgers and Adams never having been better, you wouldn't bet against Davante having a day.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Now, what is the one thing that teams have to be afraid of when they go to Green Bay in January? Yep, it's the cold. Sub-freezing temperatures are expected at Lambeau on Saturday, and Jared Goff has not been a very good QB in those kind of conditions. In 2 career starts below 35F, he has 0 TD, 5 INT, and a 34.5 passer rating. With the Packers offense playing as well as it is, the Rams will need points to win this game and they won't get many if their QB plays like that, especially against a Packers D that has allowed fewer than 17 points in 4 of their last 5 games.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The outcome of this game really rests on the shoulders of the Rams defense for me. If they can not get torched by Aaron Rodgers and that red hot Packers offense, then they can give their offense a chance to outscore their opponent. Getting turnovers will be key for the Rams too, as they need to give their offense a short field. This matchup between Rodgers and the Rams defense is the fourth matchup in the last 50 years between the pass TD leader and the defense that allowed the fewest pass TD that season. The pass TD leader is 3 - 0 so far.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Out of Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen, who do you think has a better career TD to INT ratio? Yep, it's Lamar. What about completion percentage? Lamar again. Passer rating? Lamar. Obviously all that data includes their previous seasons, and Allen has been far better this year, but there are some misconceptions about Lamar, and one of them was we thought he couldn't win a playoff game, which he disproved last week against the Titans. This game is going to depend a lot on how he plays individually, and whether or not he is ready to silence those critics for good.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>As we know, the Ravens defense is one of the scariest defenses in the league, but a key part of their defense - stopping the run - is something the Bills don't even depend on anyway. As per usual, the Bills will have to get about 80% of their offensive yardage from the passing game, and rely heavily on Allen finding his Pro Bowl receiver Diggs consistently. Diggs has 8 games of 100+ receiving yards this season, but he may find it hard to get that kind of success against a Ravens secondary that has allowed just 2 100+ yard receivers in 2020.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>That defense really was excellent for Baltimore last week, allowing just 13 points to a team that averaged 30.7 PPG in the regular season. Another key area that they are really good in is on 3rd down. They allowed just 34% of all 3rd downs to be converted against them this year, and the Bills only went 2 for 9 last week against the Colts. That obviously allowed the Colts to control the time of possession pretty easily, and although that didn't lead to an Indy win, that is exactly what the Ravens can and will have to do this week in order to beat Buffalo.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Bills' win last week was kind of labored, very close, almost like 'Phew we didn't lose', which is concerning given how much of a heavy favorite they were. The Ravens on the other hand were small underdogs against the Titans but everyone on their roster stepped up, including Lamar who bounced back from an early interception to get his first ever playoff win. I think Baltimore is gunna be fired up going into this game and it seems like there is a lot of pressure on Josh Allen and the Bills to come away with a win this week. Allen is 5 - 0 against top 10 defenses this year, but all good things have to come to an end, right?</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Well, the last time the Chiefs played a Divisional Round game coming off a bye, they were down 24 - 0 in the first half. And what was the score in Cleveland's game last week? Oh, that's right, they were up 28 - 0 in the first quarter. Chiefs fans you can relax because I don't think anything crazy like that will happen to you this week. Don't get me wrong, the Browns were super impressive last week and the way Baker Mayfield has played and handled himself this season has actually been very promising. This, however, might be a step too far for the Dawg Pound.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The narrative surrounding the Chiefs that they are not as good as they were last year because they finished the regular season with 7 straight wins by only one score (excluding Week 17 when their starters were inactive) is ridiculous. The Chiefs pretty much controlled all of those games from start to finish. They dominated a very good Saints team who got a garbage time touchdown to make it look close, the same thing happened against Tampa Bay and Miami, and everybody knew they were beating the Raiders when Mahomes got the ball down 3 with 2 minutes left.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Andy Reid's record off a bye is ridiculous too at 25 - 5, and he has never lost to the Browns in his entire career. There is honestly no way the Browns can beat this Chiefs team. I think it could be close but the Chiefs do an exceptional job of closing out games or winning them at the buzzer. It has been a very positive season for the Browns, Kevin Stefanski is the coach of the year in my opinion, and Baker Mayfield has shown he can be their franchise QB. That win against the Steelers was a real high point for them, especially given the fact that the Steelers could have stopped the Browns from entering the postseason by beating them in Week 17, but they will come back down to Earth on Sunday.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This is the only correct way to end Divisional Weekend, with 2 of the all-time greats going at it. Tom Brady and Drew Brees met twice already this season, and the Saints absolutely dominated the series with wins of 34 - 23 and 38 - 3. But don't be fooled. Both of those games were in the first half of the season, and the Bucs really hadn't figured out their offense yet. After ending the regular season with 2 straight games of 40+ points, and putting up 31 last week, it's safe to say that Brady and his receivers have a pretty good chemistry now.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It is very hard for a team to beat another team 3 times in the same season, especially when the 2 teams are this evenly matched. It is going to be a very close game, but there are a couple of players who I think will be game changers, and the first is Antonio Brown. Mike Evans, who looks to be back at full health, averages just 51 YPG against the Saints in his career, and was locked up by Saints CB Marshon Lattimore. That will leave it up to AB to be the leading receiver for the Bucs, and he is no stranger to being the #1 guy. His chemistry with Brady has been superb recently too, the pair linking up for 5 TDs in the last 4 games.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another game-changer in this matchup is Alvin Kamara. He draws a very tough matchup against the top-ranked Bucs rush defense, but he is so good at finding holes and gaining extra yards after contact. If he is able to get going on the ground too, it means the Saints offense will be more 2-dimensional, whereas the Bucs offense will likely be passing 70-80% of the time with their 29th-ranked rushing attack going against the 4th-best rushing defense in the league.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It feels like there is more pressure on Brees here too, with him likely retiring after this season, as opposed to Brady who has another year left on his contract. The Saints have had very realistic shots to win a Super Bowl in each of the last 3 seasons, and were arguably the best team in the NFC last year despite finishing with the #3 seed. There has been little to no continuity for the Saints this season, with Michael Thomas out, then Drew Brees out, then Alvin Kamara out, but the team is back at full strength now and at least one of these seasons has to end in a Super Bowl, otherwise it is a big missed opportunity for them.</p>
