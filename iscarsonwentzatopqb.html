                <p>The Philadelphia Eagles are currently one of three 2019 playoff teams yet to record a win this season (0 - 2 - 1), and a big reason why is their leader, QB Carson Wentz, has really struggled. Through the first 3 weeks, he has already been picked 6 times - he only had 7 INTs in each of his previous 3 seasons. He has also thrown only 3 TD passes, is on pace to record a career low completion percentage for a season (59.8%), and has a lower than average passer rating of 63.9. This is not the Carson Wentz that we've seen in previous seasons, and certainly not the same one that some NFL experts have mentioned in the same breath as Russell Wilson. With his recent struggles, can we really still classify Wentz as an elite QB in the NFL?</p>

		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>One factor that offers an argument against him being a top QB is that he really hasn't had to face great defenses so far in 2020. The Washington Football Team have a fairly average defense, and although they got so much pressure on him in Week 1, resulting in an incredible 8 sacks, Wentz has had magical escapability in previous years. The Bengals, who the Eagles tied with in Week 3, have one of the worst defenses in the league, and Wentz still put up a poor passing stat line with 225 yards, 1 TD, and 2 INTs, as he clearly struggled for the third straight game. To be an elite QB in this league, you have to play well against good defenses, like Mahomes against the Ravens on Monday night. Sadly, so far in 2020, Wentz has played neither good nor against good defenses (excluding the Rams), which is a worrying sign for Eagles fans.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>What's the saying though, form is temporary, class is permanent? That could definitely be applicable to this scenario, as Wentz has been one of the best QBs in the league in previous seasons. In 2017, he went 11 - 2 as a starter before suffering an injury that kept him out of the Eagles' Super Bowl run, and would have been a more than likely MVP winner had he played a full season. We also saw glimpses of this kind of form last season, when he rallied his 5 - 7 Eagles squad to a 4 game winning streak that secured them a playoff berth. The most impressive part about that run was the fact that he was playing with an extremely depleted offensive group, with Zach Ertz, Alshon Jeffery, and Desean Jackson all out towards the end of 2019. Getting it done without your best players definitely makes a QB elite, and it is something that a lot of other QBs like Deshaun Watson, Kirk Cousins, even Tom Brady last year, have not been able to do.</p>

		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>What is often hidden in that 4 game winning streak however is the Eagles' opponents. During that stretch that led them to the playoffs, they played the Giants twice, Washington once, and Dallas once - hardly a difficult stretch to go unbeaten in. Taking a look at the other 12 games from 2019 when Philadelphia went 5 - 7, it's obvious that Wentz often struggles against good teams. He was blown out by the Vikings, scored just 10 points against New England, and 9 against Seattle. There were some good performances though, as he was able to lead the Eagles to victories over the Packers and Bills, games in which they scored 30+ points, but it is too often that Wentz doesn't play well against good teams. Over the past 3 seasons, he is just 7 - 16 against teams that aren't Washington or the Giants.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Based on all of that evidence, including the most recent from 2020, it's hard to classify Wentz as an elite QB in the NFL. Even though he has beem known to make some incredible plays that involve him escaping from an almost certain sack, or scrambling only for him to fire a bullet to the endzone on the run, that is actually becoming quite common in the league these days, so that isn't really criteria for being elite at the QB position. The criteria for that is really being able to grind out a win for your team against other good teams, and that is something Wentz just hasn't been able to do over the course of his career really. Yes he had a fantastic season in 2017 and should have been MVP, but does that make him elite? Not necessarily, for example Matt Ryan, who won the MVP award in the 2016 season, is not someone that most people would consider an elite QB. We see it with Mahomes, Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Tom Brady etc. - big plays when it matters most, and that is something Wentz doesn't do often enough to be considered an elite QB in my opinion.</p>
