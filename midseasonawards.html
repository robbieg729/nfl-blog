					<p>The 2020 NFL season was in doubt back in the summer, but after kicking off as scheduled on Thursday, September 10, it has now reached its midway point after Week 9, with more than 128 of the 256 regular season games played. This season has so far seen lots of interesting storylines, outstanding plays, exciting finishes, and surprising records. With half it completed, here are my midseason NFL awards, including MVP, Rookie of the Year, Coach of the Year, and much more.</p>

				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This is probably the most tightly contested of any of the awards. The battle for OROY between Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert is really close, but I think Burrow does have the slight edge at the moment. Although Herbert does have the better statistical season so far (17 TD, 5 INT, 104.7 QBR), Burrow (11 TD, 5 INT, 91.4 QBR) has been put in a much tougher situation with a defense that has constantly let him down this year, and has had to throw the ball 330 times (average 41 attempts per game) which is extremely difficult with the offensive line the Bengals have. Moreover, Burrow has more wins so far (2) than Herbert (1), and had an extremely impressive performance in a win over the 5 - 1 Titans in Week 8. This is definitely an award worth monitoring though as it seems to be on a week-to-week basis almost. If Burrow can knock off the undefeated Steelers this week though, something that is very possible given how poor Pittsburgh was in Week 9, then it would be a huge argument in his favor for OROY.</p>

				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Unlike last season with 49ers DE Nick Bosa, there really isn't a clear, dominant defensive rookie in the league. DE Chase Young of the Washington Football Team was a projected lock for this award before the season began, but he has been relatively quiet recently with just one sack in his past 5 games. That has allowed Jeremy Chinn, the safety of the Carolina Panthers, to take the lead in the DROY race. Chinn has been a big part of Carolinas much improved defense, with 38 solo tackles, 1 INT, and 5 pass defenses through his first 9 games of his career. He was also used to carry a successful fake punt attempt in a Thursday night game against the Falcons, showing that the team already trusts him a lot.</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 37">Dalvin Cook, RB, MIN</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This award was won by a WR, Michael Thomas, in 2019 after his record-setting 149 catches in a single NFL season, and it's almost in the hands of another WR, Davante Adams, this year, but Dalvin Cook is my pick halfway through the 2020 season. Cook has played just 7 games in 2020, but has racked up 858 rushing yards, and 12 TD. In the last two games alone, he has rushed for 369 yards, 5 TDs, while also gathering 109 receiving yards and a TD. He is absolutely unstoppable right now and the Vikings wouldn't be anywhere near 3 - 5 without him. Cook could also deserve a mention as an MVP candidate if there weren't 3 top QBs tearing it up right now. The last two MVPs who were RBs, Adrian Peterson (2012) and Ladainian Tomlinson (2006) both had less rush yards, TDs, and total yards from scrimmage through their first 7 games than Cook. He is a lock for OPOY if he continues his tear in the latter half of the 2020 season.</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 37">Myles Garrett, DE, CLE</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>There was a lot of controversy surrounding Myles Garrett last season when he was suspended for brutally hitting Steelers QB Mason Rudolph with his helmet, but he has come back strong and is for sure the leading DPOY candidate in 2020. Garrett has been making life tough for every QB he has faced so far, and has a league-leading 9 sacks, and a league-leading 4 forced fumbles. This is really the most dominant we have seen him be in his entire career thus far, as he is set to conclude his fourth year in pro football with what he hopes will be at least a playoff run of some sort. And if he keeps wreaking havoc like he has been, then January football is a huge possibility for the Browns this season.</p>

					<img src="images/players\bigben.png" style="width: 90">

				<div class="col">
					<h3 style="margin-top: 37">Ben Roethlisberger, QB, PIT</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>There isn't really any other suitable candidate for this award other than Big Ben in Pittsburgh. After suffering a season-ending injury in Week 2 of the 2019 NFL season, Roethlisberger has come back and led his Pittsburgh Steelers to an undefeated 8 - 0 start in 2020, which not a lot of people saw coming. Most thought that the Steelers would end up 9 - 7 or 10 - 6, but they already have 8 wins with 8 games to go, and Big Ben has had a big say in that. He currently has 1934 passing yards, 18 pass TDs, just 4 INTs, and a QBR of 101.4, all of which are outstanding stats for someone coming off of injury. The only other potential candidates for this award coming into the season were Cam Newton and maybe AJ Green, but both have got off to disappointing starts with neither of their teams over .500, so CPOY has to be Big Ben.</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 28">Brian Flores, MIA</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Brian FLores did a good job with Miami towards the end of last season, but no one expected them to be 5 - 3 through Week 9 of the 2020 season. The former Patriots linebacker coach has done an inspired job with his defense, which is now one of the best in the league, and his team have now won 4 straight after a 1 - 3 start, and have knocked off 3 out of 4 teams from the NFC West, the NFLs toughest division. A lot of people were sceptical of his and the front offices decision to start Tua ahead of Fitzpatrick despite how well the veteran was playing, but I like that they want to know right now what they have in Tua, and so far its looking good as the #5 overall pick is 2 - 0 as a starter. Flores is definitely the leading candidate for this award and has done a tremendous job, but not so far behind is Steelers HC Mike Tomlin, who has shocked the league by getting his Steelers to an 8 - 0 start.</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 37">Patrick Mahomes, QB, KC</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The biggest award of them all, the MVP. Through the first half of the season, there has been so much hype about Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers, particularly Wilson, who was the leading MVP candidate for most of the first 9 weeks until a poor performance last Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. That has opened the door for Patrick Mahomes to take the lead in the MVP race. Last years Super Bowl MVP has almost quietly had an incredible year thus far, and lets not get too cute about it - Patrick Mahomes is the most valuable player that any team has at the moment, and the numbers back it up. He is second overall in passing yards (2687), has a 25:1 TD:INT ratio (the all-time single season NFL record is 14:1), and has a QBR of 115.9, which is third (behind Rodgers and Wilson). Out of the 3 top candidates, Mahomes also has the best record in 2020 (8 - 1). For Rodgers and Wilson to retake the lead as MVP, they will have to outplay Mahomes, which is incredibly hard to do, especially when he is as hot as he is right now.</p>
