					<p>The NFL season has almost reached it's climax, as we are down to the final 4 teams with Conference Championship Sunday only a few days away. The NFC game will be a contest of 2 of the greatest QBs in NFL history, as Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady go head-to-head in their first postseason meeting. On the flip side, the AFC matchup sees 2 young but extremely talented QBs, Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, fight it out for the right to face Green Bay or Tampa Bay on February 7. It is fairly undeniable that the 4 remaining teams are the 4 best in the league this year, but no team is ever perfect (okay, maybe the '72 Dolphins were), so here is one area each team needs to work on if they want to hoist the Lombardi Trophy in just a few weeks time.</p>

			  	</div>	
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>If I were Matt LaFleur, I wouldn't even try to change anything about the Packers' offense. Every single aspect of it has been virtually flawless this season. The run game, the passing game, pass protection and run blocking have been something to behold for Green Bay fans in 2020. The defense, however, has not been as potent. Although it has allowed 18 points or fewer in 5 of the last 6 games, the Packers have the 7th-fewest takeaways in the league this year, and given that this week, they face a Tampa Bay side that has the 6th-most takeaways, it may be crucial that the defense turns Tom Brady and the Bucs over.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Forcing turnovers for any team is big because it gives the ball back to your offense so that they might score some points, but when you give the ball back to a guy like Aaron Rodgers and his offense, it is even bigger because you know that you have a higher chance of scoring than not (Green Bay has more pass TDs than punts in 2020). Takeaways can then create those 14 point swings, by effectively stopping the opponent from scoring, and letting your offense score instead. Those kind of things would make it even more difficult to beat the Packers, and could be crucial against potent offenses like Kansas City, Buffalo, and Tampa Bay.</p>

			  	</div>	
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Bucs offense has really hit its stride over the last few weeks and showed just how good it was by putting up 30 points against the #5 scoring defense, the New Orleans Saints, in the Divisional Round. One area that has been particularly awful for them all season though is their rushing attack. Tampa Bay's ground game ranks 4th-worst in the league with just 94.9 YPG, and you would think with a backfield duo like Ronald Jones and Leonard Fournette, they would be able to run for a lot more yardage than that.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Establishing a more efficient ground game really is the last piece of the puzzle for Tampa Bay. Their defense has been playing very well, as they turned Drew Brees and the Saints over 4 times last week, and Brady has much better connections with his receivers, particularly on deep throws, than he did earlier in the season. The good news for the Bucs with regard to their running game is that they were able to rush for 127 yards against a Saints defense that allowed only 93.9 YPG on the ground in 2020, so there are definite signs of an upward trend heading into their huge game against Green Bay.</p>

			  	</div>	
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>We all know Kansas City is a heavy passing team, so you might think that they need to work on a more productive ground game like the Bucs. However, their rushing attack has actually come up big when it has needed to, and did help the offense get some momentum when Patrick Mahomes exited the game against the Browns on Sunday. The one area that has not been good for the Chiefs throughout 2020 has been their redzone defense. Kansas City has the worst redzone D in the league, allowing a TD on 76.6% of opponents' drives in that area of the field.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>With Patrick Mahomes on the other side of the ball, the Chiefs can of course win in a shootout, but wouldn't it just be so much more comfortable for them if they didn't have to? Suppose that they meet Green Bay in the Super Bowl, and instead of allowing Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams to connect on their weekly 1-yard TD pass, they were able to force a field goal. That would be absolutely massive for two reasons, one being the immense amount of confidence it would give their defense, and the other being that Mahomes is very likely going to lead the offense for a TD on the next drive. It is easier said than done, especially against offenses as potent as the Packers', but it might be necessary if they want to repeat.</p>

			  	</div>	
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Buffalo Bills have navigated their way through this postseason relatively safely so far, and against the Colts and the Ravens, they were dominated in terms of the time of possession, as they had the ball for no more than 26 minutes in each game. So if they can win comfortably without controlling the time of possession, then why do they need to? Well, the answer is, the offenses of Indy and Baltimore are nothing like what they are about to face this week, and potentially in Super Bowl LV if they get there.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The other 3 teams left in the playoffs all have top 6 scoring offenses (GB #1, TB #3, KC #6), so they are no strangers to driving down the field methodically and putting up points. Against offenses like those, it's real important that you keep them off the field, especially also considering that they can put up points in a flash. Unfortunately for the Bills, one of the things that can help you control the TOP, an efficient running game, is something they don't really have, especially with Zack Moss out. Another thing that helps is being able to get your defense off the field, but as we saw with Green Bay last week, who had 36 minutes of possession, even the best defense can't stop them, and I expect the same will be true for the Chiefs.</p>
