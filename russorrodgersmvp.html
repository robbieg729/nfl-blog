					<p>The NFL has largely made it through the first month of the season without any major COVID-19 scares, with just one game so far being postponed to a later week (Steelers at Titans Week 7). In the games that have gone ahead, which is 63 so far, there have been some incredibly high scoring games, such as the Browns' 49 - 38 win over Dallas last week, and Dallas' 40 - 39 win over Atlanta in Week 2. Whether this is due to a lack of defensive preparation in a quieter-than-usual preseason or something else is up for debate, but one thing that is for sure is offenses are cooking, in large part due to some dazzling QB play. A number of players have already made themselves known as potential MVP candidates, but there's two that stand out.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson have undoubtedly been top 5 QBs in the NFL for a while now, and they're really showing off their feathers so far in 2020. Wilson set an NFL record for most passing TDs through a team's first 3 games of a season with 14, and added two more in Week 4 against Miami. 'DangerRuss' also has a 75.2% completion rate, 1285 passing yards, just 2 picks, and an unbelievable QB rating of 136.7. The best part about Wilson's game in his career has definitely been his deep ball throws, and that seems to have gotten even better this year with multiple long range strikes to DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, and David Moore to lead his Seahawks team to a perfect 4 - 0 start.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Meanwhile in Green Bay, Aaron Rodgers has also been lighting it up to lead the Packers to their first 4 - 0 start in 9 years. The former two-time MVP has recorded a 70.5% completion rate on 1214 passing yards, along with 13 TDs, 0 picks, and a QB rating of 128.4. The numbers are highly impressive, though just comparing them with Wilson's will make you think that Russ is the obvious choice for early season MVP, as he has better stats across the board except in the interceptions column. So why is there even a consideration that Rodgers could wind up winning season MVP?</p>
				</div>	
			</div>			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Well, first of all, it's still early in the season, and while it's unlikely that Russ or Rodgers starts to cool off, it's definitely possible that one increases their playing level and establishes a solid lead for season MVP. Of course, neither may end up receiving the award, as there are a number of other hot QBs around the league right now, including Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, and arguably even Cam Newton as a dark horse contender. Just looking at Wilson and Rodgers though, it could be argued that Rodgers' start to the season is more impressive because he's had less to do it with.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>He has been without his star WR Davante Adams since Week 2 against the Lions, and despite getting Adams about 10 targets every game since the pair have been at Green Bay, the loss barely seems to have fazed #12. He even lost his secondary WR, Allen Lazard, prior to Week 4 against the Falcons, and still threw for 327 yards and 4 TDs with a passer rating of 147.5. Wilson, on the other hand, has had his favorite targets to throw to in each game thus far, and while this comparable factor doesn't take anything away from Russ's outstanding play, it can in some ways make Rodgers' first 4 weeks seem more impressive.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another thing to consider with the MVP award is that people often like to vote for the better story. That has been evident in the NBA recently, particularly in the 2019 season when Giannis Antetokounmpo won season MVP ahead of James Harden, who some argue deserved it more. In this case, it could make more sense if Aaron Rodgers won the MVP award this year, as the story of the Packers drafting a QB in the first round of the 2020 draft, only for their current starting QB to go and have an MVP season, would appeal to many experts (the MVP voters) across the league.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The media does play a big part in the outcome of the MVP voting, and for that reason, if the season ended today, Russell Wilson would probably be the MVP because of the hype that has been surrounding him, and not Rodgers, through the first 4 weeks. While there are several arguments in Rodgers' favor as previously mentioned, there has been a bit more talk around the league about how Russell Wilson is finally on his way to winning league MVP, which obviously works in his favor. Sometimes it can just be useful to take a look at the numbers, and make a judgement based on them. Wilson has also, somewhat astonishingly, never even had a single MVP vote, while Rodgers has won the actual award twice, so maybe that comes into play too as voters give Russ the award his play has warranted for so long.</p>
