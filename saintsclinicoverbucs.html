					<p>Sunday night's game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints was billed as a classic duel between two of the greatest QBs of all-time in Drew Brees and Tom Brady. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype, as the Saints delivered a masterful performance in a 38 - 3 victory that saw them return to the top of the NFC South. What was even more surprising about the result was that many people thought the Buccaneers would win following some impressive performances in recent weeks, but Brees and the Saints shut everybody up with a clinic on both sides of the ball. How did they do it?</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The defense really set the tone right from the first play in this ball game, as Cam Jordan was able to get pressure on Brady right away, leading to a three-and-out on the opening possession. They also were able to force 3 consecutive three-and-outs after that, giving Tampa Bay absolutely nothing while the Saints offense was quickly building a lead. The defensive line consistently got pressure with 5 QB hits and 3 hurries in the first half, and even if Tampa Bays offensive line was able to give Brady enough time, the Saints' downfield coverage was superb, with Marshon Lattimore holding Mike Evans to 0 catches for the fourth straight time those two have faced off.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Most of the first half shutout can be credited to the Saints excellent defense, but the Buccaneers did seem incredibly out of sync all night, with Brady not himself as he threw 3 INTs including an awful throw that he just put up for grabs. Once Tampa Bay was down 31 - 0, they had to start forcing things, but the fact that they couldn't get a first down until their fifth drive is very concerning. Brady just couldn't connect with any of his receivers really, and the chemistry with Gronk that had been there the last few weeks all but dissipated on Sunday night with a simple dropped catch on 3rd and Goal from the 1. Brady's best connection in the game was actually with newcomer Antonio Brown, which was about the only encouraging thing for Tampa Bay all night.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The story of the night was definitely the Saints defense effectively kicking Brady out of the MVP conversation, but Drew Brees and his offense were perhaps more impressive against a very tough Bucs defense. It started with the offensive line, which gave their QB great protection by pushing the Tampa Bay pass rush wide to create a huge pocket that gave Brees time to find his receivers. What also gave Brees more time was the gameplan that Todd Bowles, Tampa Bays defensive coordinator put together. In Week 6 against the Packers, Bowles decided to blitz a lot because Aaron Rodgers does not have a super quick release. Drew Brees on the other hand is accustomed to short yardage throws in which he gets the ball out quickly, so Bowles decided not to blitz anywhere near as much with his LBs, a curious decision given how speedy Devin White and Lavonte David are.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It was clear that having Michael Thomas back helped Brees and the offense, but he was barely even a factor. Brees found 11 different receivers in the first half, which is the sign of an extremely efficient offense, and also keeps the Bucs defense guessing as to where the ball is going to go next. The best part of the Saints offense last night though was Taysom Hill. He has been a Swiss army knife for this New Orleans team for several years now, and he showed his credentials again last night as he threw for 48 yards, rushed for 54 (team high) and had 21 receiving yards too. Cris Collinsworth, who was on the call for NBC, said that Hill is 'one of the most intimidating runners in the league', and the Buccaneers sure agree with that after Sunday.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>New Orleans' offense was just efficient all night in general, and that was really the biggest factor in them opening up a huge lead so early on. Even though it wasn't a great game to watch, it was certainly an important one in the context of the NFC playoffs. Coming into the game, Tampa Bay had a 61% chance of winning the NFC South, but after Sunday's heavy loss, the Saints are now favored at 63% to take the division and claim a top 4 seed in the conference, meaning a home playoff game on Wild Card weekend at the very least. It also marked the first time that Brady has been swept by a division opponent in a season, though not much can really be said about that given that Brady had spent all of his career up to this season in the AFC East. Either way, all the Saints care about is that they won, and they will look to build on this result when a battered 49ers team comes into town next week.</p>
