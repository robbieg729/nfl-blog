					<p>Antonio Brown was one of the best WRs in the league during his 9-year stay in Pittsburgh, and although he never won a Super Bowl ring, he was certainly on pace for an induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Following some turbulence with the Steelers however, Brown decided to take his talents elsewhere and signed with the then Oakland Raiders. That ended pretty swiftly for AB, as the Raiders released him after he got into a heated fight with GM Mike Mayock. The NFL world was then shocked when he signed a deal with Tom Brady's Patriots only a few weeks later, but it never really took off and he was released yet again.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Brown has since been back and forth about whether or not he wants to make a return to the NFL, but the league ensured that it wouldn't be for quite some time by suspending him for violating the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy at the end of July. That suspension was set at 8 games, and with Week 8 of the 2020 season just around the corner, Brown will soon be eligible to play again, and it's looking like he could make a remarkable return with multiple teams interested in signing the 4-time All Pro free agent, per Adam Schefter of ESPN. The team that has expressed the most interest according to Schefter is none other than the currently undefeated Seattle Seahawks, who sit at 5 - 0 and are on top of the NFC. The only question is, would this be a smart move by Seattle?</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The short answer is no, and there are several reasons why. First of all, the Seahawks don't need him. As previously mentioned, they're unbeaten, and it's because of Russell Wilson's insane chemistry with his WRs, particularly DK Metcalf who has established himself as one of the most dangerous deep threats in all of football. It just goes back to the old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. The main reason that the Seahawks are the frontrunners to sign Brown is because Wilson and his backup Geno Smith reportedly have a good relationship with him, and that's probably true given they spent some time working out together during the summer.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>So the chemistry with the QBs might be good, but what about the chemistry with the rest of the team? Brown obviously has a bit of a toxic reputation when it comes to the locker room and clashing with the front office, and drama like that could very easily derail this Seahawks team that has been clicking on all cylinders, particularly on offense.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Thirdly, even though the Seahawks are undefeated, there is always room for improvement, and it is definitely not on the offensive side of the ball for Seattle. Their defense has been a major issue at times and has led to lots of close games that really shouldn't be close. Ranked 26th overall in the league, they have struggled at times with both the running game and passing game this season. In their most recent game against the Vikings, they allowed Dalvin Cook's backup Alexander Mattison to run all over them, forcing Wilson to lead an epic last minute drive that won the game. In Week 3, they allowed Cowboys QB Dak Prescott to throw for 472 yards, and its secondary has given up 108 catches and 1472 receiving yards to WRs in 2020, which is the most by any team in the first 5 games of a season in the Super Bowl era.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>So clearly, the issues lie with Seattle's defense, and although they have some studs like Jamal Adams and Bobby Wagner, they should definitely spend some time exploring options to bolster their defense, rather than their offense, which could suffer if Brown signs with the Seahawks, especially if we see more drama like we have in previous years. That is really the main reason why Seattle should not go and sign Brown, because they just don't need him, he doesn't add much to this already on-fire offense, and adding him could have dire consequences.</p>
