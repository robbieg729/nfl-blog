					<p>This year's NFL offseason could be one of the most interesting in league history, with a wild QB carousel shaping up nicely. On Saturday, we saw the first of possibly quite a few blockbuster trades, as long-time Lions QB Matt Stafford was dealt to the Rams for Jared Goff, a 2021 third round pick, and two future first round picks (2022 and 2023). It marks the first time ever in the NFL that two former #1 overall picks have been involved in the same trade, but in my opinion, there is clearly one team which got the better of this deal, and that is the Detroit Lions.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Matt Stafford is an extremely talented QB, don't get me wrong. His arm ability and no look throws go very unnoticed by the media, and he is just one of two QBs in NFL history with 45,000+ pass yards and fewer than 150 INTs (Aaron Rodgers). But in his 12 seasons in the NFL, he has only had 4 with a winning record. Granted, the NFC North has been a pretty tough division to win with Aaron Rodgers over there in Green Bay, and Stafford has never really had it good in Detroit. He's never had a reliable ground game, and he's never really had much of a defense either.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>But he has often had the receiving weapons, like Calvin Johnson, Kenny Golladay, and Marvin Jones, and to only have 4 winning seasons in his entire career, for a QB of his talent, is pretty poor. Meanwhile, the guy that the Rams just gave away, Jared Goff, has 4 winning seasons out of 4 (not counting his first season when he only played 7 games). Yeah, okay, the Rams have a terrific defense, but Goff is still a QB who went to the Super Bowl only 2 years ago, and it was his offense that actually helped them get there, as they averaged almost 33 PPG during the regular season in 2018.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Goff hasn't exactly been lights out since that run to the Super Bowl, with 42 TD and 29 INT, but I believe he is still a very capable QB with the right receivers. And guess what? The Lions now have two more first round picks in the next 2 years thanks to the trade, so they can build around Goff and give him the weapons he needs. Although they already have receivers like Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay, those guys are big downfield threats, which is not really Goff's style, so the Lions may have to look into changing their receiving group if they want Goff to succeed. On the other hand, if Goff fits in well, they can use the extra picks on defense.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The fact that Detroit's receivers don't really suit Goff is why this trade doesn't make a lot of sense, especially considering that the Rams' receievers don't really fit Stafford, who likes to throw deep a lot. Sean McVay's offensive scheme just isn't well suited to Stafford, and given that the Rams now have two fewer first round picks in the future, it's going to be hard for them to acquire some talented deep threats that Stafford has been used to his whole career. He'll finally have a defense, which is good news for him, but if he can't get that offense to click, it might not count for much.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>								
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>I can understand why the Rams wanted to make this trade. They wanted a better QB than Goff, because he has kind of regressed since they went to the Super Bowl, but I think they would actually be better off keeping him than trading for Stafford. They gave up way too much for a guy who has had a winning record in only a third of his pro years, and I just don't see how they can fit him into their scheme without Sean McVay drastically changing his philosophy. Stafford would have been better off going to the 49ers or the Colts. The Lions, on the other hand, couldn't have asked for much more really, because they received a QB who was in the Super Bowl just 2 years ago, and even if it doesn't work out with Goff, the fact that they now have two extra first round picks over the next 2 years means they could draft a replacement for him.</p>
