					<p>The 2020 NFL playoffs are ever so close to getting underway now, with 3 games set to kickoff on Saturday and 3 more on Sunday to determine who advances to Divisional Weekend, when 2 more teams begin their postseason run. There are usually only 4 games on Wild Card Weekend each year, but because of the NFL's new CBA, a seventh seed was added in each conference, which benefitted both the Colts and Bears who claimed the final spot in their respective conferences. This weekend's games include some very good matchups, including divisional showdowns and revenge games, so let's take a look at each one and see who will keep their season alive.</p>
				</div>

				<table style="width:58%">
					<tr>
						<th><img src="images/Colts.png"></th>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h4>(7) Indianapolis Colts at Buffalo Bills (2)</h4></th>
						<th><img src="images/Bills.png"></th>
					</tr>						
				</table>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Although this is a 7 vs. 2 matchup, this game might be a lot closer than you think. It isn't a great matchup for Buffalo in their first home playoff game since 1996, and there are a couple of things that they may have to overcome in order to advance. The Colts are a very run-heavy team and they do it exceptionally well with their rookie Jonathan Taylor, who led all rookies in rushing yards in the regular season (1,169). This draws a good matchup against a Buffalo defense that has allowed almost 120 rush YPG in 2020, and the Bills themselves do not have a very good ground game of their own, averaging less than 110 YPG, while the Colts defense allows only 90. Those are some of the mismatches that Frank Reich will be looking to exploit in his gameplan.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another good-looking contest that people may be looking at in this game is Josh Allen's much-improved passing game against the Colts secondary, which allows just 242 pass YPG. However, since Week 13, they have actually allowed 311 pass YPG, which is second worst in the league, and in that stretch, Allen has thrown for 15 TD and just 2 picks. With the Allen-Diggs connection having been lethal all season, it could be a long day for those Indy DBs if they can't force Allen into some uncomfortable throws.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>So both teams have a few mismatches that they can look to take advantage of, and the key will be who can exploit their mismatches better, but in the end I think Buffalo will win. They are simply too hot right now and absolutely torched a very well-coached Miami defense in Week 17. The Bills also have a better 3rd down offense and 3rd down defense, and are also more clinical in the redzone, which could be a key area in which this game is won or lost. The numbers definitely support Buffalo, but don't rule out the Colts pulling off a shock.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This is the first of 2 divisional games this weekend, and it is a big one especially for Russell Wilson and the Seahawks. Russ was the odds on MVP favorite early in the season but he and his offense have dropped off the pace massively since, and they draw a very tough matchup against a Rams defense that allow a league-low 18.5 PPG. This is likely to be a very low-scoring game and it will probably come down to whose defense can step up and make the play, and most people would assume that would be the Rams defense.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>However, Seattle's defense, which was atrocious early on, has allowed 150.4 YPG fewer in the second half of 2020, which is the largest improvement by any team since 1978. Additionally, that very same Seattle defense held the Rams offense to just 9 points in their last meeting at Lumen Field (formerly CenturyLink Field), and this time, the Rams may even be without Jared Goff, as he is questionable to play. The Rams do get a boost though with LT Andrew Whitworth expected to play for the first time since mid-November, which is important for a running game they might desperately need if Goff doesn't play.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The other 2 key areas of this matchup are Seattle's offensive line, and the redzone. The Seahawks in 2020 allowed the sixth-worst number of sacks per game with 3, and will be facing a terrifying Rams defensive front, including Aaron Donald, that has forced over 3 sacks per game this season. It's hard to get offense when you're going backwards, that's for sure. The redzone is also a big factor in this game because as I said earlier, this will be a low-scoring game, and if you can convert those redzone trips into 7 rather than 3 in a low-scoring game, you'll probably win. This is especially important in this game as the Seahawks score TDs on 73% of their redzone drives (4th in NFL), whereas the Rams do so just 58% of the time (19th in NFL).</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>In the end, I like the Seahawks to win, regardless of whether Jared Goff plays or not. Their defense has really stepped up in this second half of the season and I expect people like Jamal Adams to make some really big plays in this game. Russell Wilson also always seems to bring it in the playoffs, regardless of how his regular season has been, and although this is a very tough matchup, I think he'll pull through and find DK Metcalf on a couple of deep throws.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It might be the Buccaneers first playoff apperance since 2007, but I can assure you that their QB has been to one or two postseasons since that year. There is a little bit of unfamiliarity for Tom Brady though in that this is the first time he has ever been a Wild Card, but I don't expect that to play any real part in this game. It has been a terrific season for Alex Smith, Ron Rivera, and the whole of this Washington franchise who were really a laughing stock of the league when they changed their franchise name to 'Football Team', but this is the end of the road for them here.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>There were concerns earlier in the season about Brady's problems with the deep ball, but that has been much improved over the last few weeks and the addition of Antonio Brown has almost surprisingly worked out very well. Washington's defense has played at a very high level all year, allowing the second-fewest YPG, fourth-fewest PPG, and has the sixth-most sacks, but the Bucs offense is simply too hot right now, even possibly without star WR Mike Evans.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Additionally, there is too much discrepancy in the offensive numbers these 2 teams are putting up. The Bucs have just under 67 YPG more, almost 10 PPG more, and the Football Team's offensive line has allowed over 3 sacks per game this season, which is not ideal going up against a Bucs D-line with the fifth-most sacks in the league. The run game that Washington relies heavily on too is going to be completely nullified by the Bucs #1 run defense. There just simply doesn't seem like there is any way Washington can score in this game. Bucs all the way.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Everybody loves a good revenge game, right? Ravens QB Lamar Jackson has often come under criticism in his career and has a reputation as a guy who can't perform in the playoffs. Well, here is his chance to prove the doubters wrong and avenge the outcome of his last playoff game in which the #6 seeded Titans dumped the #1 seeded Ravens out of contention last season. In that game, the Ravens allowed Derrick Henry to bulldoze them for over 200 rushing yards, and they simply cannot afford to do that again this time, because it will allow the Titans to build a lead and control the clock, and Lamar Jackson doesn't usually play well from behind.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>So for the Ravens, this game is all about setting an early tone and establishing a lead. For that reason, if they win the toss, I think they should elect to receive the ball rather than defer, and try and score on the opening possession. Tennessee's defense is 28th in the league and has allowed all sorts of yards to the run this season, which the Ravens will undoubtedly use heavily with rookie JK Dobbins and Lamar Jackson himself.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another important thing for Lamar in this game is to not turn the ball over. He did that a couple of times in the last playoff meeting and forced way too many passes that weren't there. He has to play smart with the football, which he has done in the last few games, and also needs his defense to actually tackle King Henry this time. The ground game will be a huge part of this matchup as these are the top 2 rushing teams in the league, so whichever team can force the other into the air more will end up advancing. For me, I don't think this Ravens defense is ready to stop Henry in his tracks and he may well go over 150 yards yet again, so I think the Titans will be advancing for a probable game against the Chiefs next weekend.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Chicago Bears have lost 6 straight games to the Saints, with their last win coming all the way back in 2008, and there is no game more important for this franchise, and Mitch Trubisky, than this one on Sunday. Unfortunately though, there are a lot of numbers and stats that have them losing this game, not to mention the fact that the Saints are just a better team in general. Chicago's run game was an integral part of their late-season playoff push, but they will find no such success against this Saints defense which has allowed only 94 rush YPG in 2020 (4th in NFL).</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The 3rd down numbers are also heavily against the Bears in this matchup. Both defenses allow only around 38% of 3rd downs to be converted, which is top 10 in the league, but the Saints offense is much more efficient in that area, converting around 44% of their 3rd downs (8th in NFL), while the Bears offense is at 34%, which is a miserable 31st in the league. So, the Saints convert a 3rd down more often than the opposing defense allows, while the Bears convert a 3rd down less often than the opposing defense allows. For that reason, the Saints may end up dominating the time of possession, especially with their efficient ground game and Brees' accuracy.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Saints have had some bad history in the playoffs recently, losing twice to the Vikings including the Minneapolis Miracle, and were also unfortunate not to get the most obvious pass interference call ever in the 2018 NFC Championship Game that would have sent them to the Super Bowl. I don't think Sean Payton is going to allow anything like that to happen again though and he will game out with a very strong gameplan to beat this average Bears team. New Orleans also gets a boost with Michael Thomas being back, and it is worth noting that the Bears have only beaten one team above .500 all year (Bucs in Week 5).</p>

						<th><img src="images/Steelers.png"></th>
					</tr>						
				</table>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Cleveland Browns will be playing their first postseason game since 2002 on Sunday, and it is just their luck that they become the first team to get hit with a Covid-19 outbreak in this season's playoffs. They will unfortunately be without their Head Coach Kevin Stefanski, who has been brilliant in his first season and has really turned this franchise around, even while missing some key players like Odell Beckham Jr. and Nick Chubb. That is going to make things really hard for the Browns to win, especially considering they barely beat a Steelers team that was far from full strength last week.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It's not just the current circumstances that suggest a Steelers win, but also the history between these 2 franchises. Ben Roethlisberger is 23 - 2 - 1 all-time against the Browns, and Cleveland has not win in Pittsburgh since 2003, when Baker Mayfield was 8 years old. For them to snap that losing streak, they will need to use the ground game effectively. You might think this is hard to do against this Steelers defense, but Pittsburgh allowed 158.7 rush YPG in the 6 divisional games they played this season, and 2 of those games came against a Bengals squad without Joe Mixon. The Browns shouldn't be afraid to let Baker throw the ball though - he currently has the longest active streak of 127 passes without a pick among all QBs in the playoffs in 2020.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>For Pittsburgh, it's all about the passing game on Sunday. The Steelers average fewer rush YPG than anyone in the league with 84.4, so it is the air attack that will produce the most offense for them. That aspect of their game was impressive in their bounceback victory against the Colts in Week 16, but they will need to stop dropping so many passes, as they are tied for the most in the league (31) this season. Like the other #6 vs. #3 matchup, this will probably be a fairly low-scoring game, but the fact that the Browns will be without their usual play-caller and that they barely beat a sub-par Pittsburgh team last week leads me to believe the Steelers will move on.</p>
