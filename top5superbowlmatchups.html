					<p>Before opening night kickoff between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans on September 10, there was a lot of doubt around the league about whether or not the NFL would be able to complete it's 256-game regular season schedule in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, Washington Football Team's division-clinching win against the Eagles on Sunday night marked the end of the regular season with no cancellations, a remarkable feat by the league, and especially the commissioner, Roger Goodell.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>With that 256th game completed, the NFL now heads towards the postseason as 14 teams try to book their tickets to Tampa Bay, FL, for Super Bowl LV on Sunday, February 7. As the 14 teams are split into 2 conferences of 7, there are 49 possible matchups for the Super Bowl in Tampa, each with its own intrigue and fascinating insights. The question is, which 5 of these 49 possible permutations would be the most interesting for fans to watch?</p>
				</div>

				<table style="width:54%">

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>One thing that fans love seeing in the Super Bowl is points. A lot of them. Which Super Bowl was better, the 41 - 33 shootout between Philadelphia and New England 3 years ago, or the 13 - 3 affair between the Patriots and Rams 2 years ago? Easy answer. This matchup would certainly provide an offensive spectacle that could be talked about for ages. Possibly the top 2 MVP candidates, Aaron Rodgers and Josh Allen, would be going head-to-head, and without a doubt the top 2 receivers in football this season, Davante Adams and Stefon Diggs, would be trying to outduel the other.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>When you think about it, these teams are pretty similar. Both have an elite QB, a top 5 WR, lots of secondary weapons, and a young but incredibly competent head coach. The only real difference between the Bills and Packers is that Green Bay has a much better rushing attack, and that could play a key part in the game if one of the teams needs to burn some clock late in the fourth quarter. Either way, this would be a high-scoring matchup, and one of the most interesting things to consider is how would it look for Aaron Rodgers if he wasn't able to defeat a third-year QB in the Super Bowl.</p>

					<p>Whether or not Tom Brady retires after this season, which he probably won't, this would likely be the final meeting between Patrick Mahomes and the so-called GOAT, as the Chiefs and Bucs are not scheduled to meet in the regular season for another 4 seasons. The all-time head-to-head record between these two QBs currently stands at 2 - 2, and a Super Bowl meeting in 2020 would be like the deciding game in that head-to-head matchup. Thus, not only would it have implications on who lifts the Lombardi Trophy, it would also have implications in the GOAT conversation come the end of Mahomes' career.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>When you are trying to compare two QBs to see who is better, normally people will turn to their head-to-head record quite often, especially in the case of the GOAT debate. If Mahomes were to win that fifth game it would be huge for him in his still young career. The game itself though would be the main focus at that time, and although the previous meeting between these two this season was a little bit drab, the Bucs seem to have figured things out offensively now, so another potential shootout between Mahomes and Brady, like the 2018 AFC Championship Game, could be in play.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<table style="width:63%">
					<tr>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h2>3.</h2></th>
						<th><img src="images/Titans.png"></th>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h4>Tennessee Titans vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h4></th>
						<th><img src="images/Buccaneers.png"></th>
					</tr>						
				</table>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This would be an epic matchup for several reasons. First of all, it would be a huge revenge game for Tom Brady, as the Titans were the team that effectively ended his career as a New England Patriot by stunning them in last year's Wild Card Round. Brady is not a guy you want to go up against in a revenge game, and it could be really interesting to see how Titans HC Mike Vrabel would gameplan for this, given that his last one against Brady worked reasonably well.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Secondly, everybody knows how the Titans like to play football. Establish the run with Derrick Henry, then carve up the defense with the play-action game, which Ryan Tannehill led the league in in terms of passing yards (1,541) this season. However, the Titans might find running the ball against the Bucs quite difficult. Tampa Bay has the number 1 rush defense in the league, allowing just 80 YPG in 2020, which is not ideal to go against for a guy who averaged almost 127 YPG. This would again be interesting to see how Mike Vrabel would adjust to this, but as always, there is a chance that Derrick Henry runs all over the Bucs anyway.</p>

					<tr>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h2>2.</h2></th>
						<th><img src="images/Colts.png"></th>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h4>Indianapolis Colts vs. New Orleans Saints</h4></th>
						<th><img src="images/Saints.png"></th>
					</tr>						
				</table>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Like the Packers and Bills, these two teams are actually very similar. Both have a veteran QB likely to retire after this season, an amazing defense, a solid ground game, and reliable pass-catching weapons. Indy leans on the ground game a bit more than New Orleans because Drew Brees is a better passer of the football, but that is about the only difference between the Colts and Saints. As mentioned, Rivers and Brees, both former Chargers QBs, are likely to retire once this season is done, so it would be incredible to see which of these QBs can go out with a bang and spoil the end of the other's career.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>This would also be a rematch of the game in which Brees won his only Super Bowl ring back in 2010. The Colts of course looked very different that day as did the Saints, but it would be an interesting storyline if both of Drew Brees' rings were to come against the same franchise. The game itself would probably not be desperately high-scoring, but you feel like both offenses would have to use the passing game more than they usually do with both defenses in the top 4 in rushing. It would certainly be close and it would be nice to see Rivers finally win a Super Bowl, but to get there, he will have to beat both Buffalo and Kansas City in consecutive weeks, which is not easy.</p>

				<table style="width:60%">
					<tr>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h2>1.</h2></th>
						<th><img src="images/Chiefs.png"></th>
						<th style="color: #000000"><h4>Kansas City Chiefs vs. Green Bay Packers</h4></th>

			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>You want a shootout? Well, this matchup will certainly give you one. The young stud, Patrick Mahomes, already with a ring and Super Bowl MVP to his name, taking on the best QB in NFL history, Aaron Rodgers (no that is not up for debate). We were very close to having this matchup last season, but I don't think it would have been anywhere near as good as the one we could have this year in Tampa. Both these teams are top 6 in scoring offense (Packers 31.8 PPG, Chiefs 29.6 PPG), and against the right opponent, the defenses can allow a lot of points too.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Watching these two QBs go back and forth would be great, similar to Super Bowl LII between the Eagles and the Patriots, with the only difference being that these offenses are way more explosive and literally anything could happen at any time. In the same way that Mahomes defeating Brady in the Super Bowl would be big, defeating Aaron Rodgers might be bigger, simply because of how good he has been this season. A lot of people right now are understandably saying Rodgers is the MVP over Mahomes, but what a statement it would be if Mahomes were to beat the league MVP the night after it was announced Rodgers had won the award. As a neutral, I really hope these are the two teams we see in Tampa on Sunday, February 7.</p>
