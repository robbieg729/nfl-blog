					<p>Christmas is a special time for a lot of people around the world, especially in 2020 when nothing has gone as planned. This year though, Christmas Day is even better for football fans, as the Vikings and Saints will battle it out on Friday in a huge NFC contest that has major playoff implications. A Saints win would put pressure on the Green Bay Packers to win a tough Sunday night game against Tennessee in the race for the crucial #1 seed in the conference, while the Minnesota Vikings can only keep their slim playoff hopes alive with a victory in the Big Easy.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Even though both these teams haven't been as good as they were last year, this is still going to be a very good game to watch because of the recent history between them. In the 2017 Divisional Round, Drew Brees led the Saints back from 17 - 0 down against Minnesota to take a slender 24 - 23 lead with 10 seconds remaining, only for the 'Minneapolis Miracle' to then occur as Stefon Diggs scored a walk-off 61 yard touchdown to send New Orleans home.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Last season brought another playoff meeting between the two franchises, this time in the Wild Card Round, as the heavily favored Saints were stunned by the Vikings and Kyle Rudolph's overtime touchdown, knocking them out when most people picked them to go to the Super Bowl. There certainly has been no love lost between New Orleans and Minnesota over the past few years, so expect both teams to come out and play as hard as they possibly can, especially since they are each desperate for a win after consecutive losses.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Despite the fact that these two teams did meet only 11 months ago, there are a lot of things that are going to be different this time around. First of all, it is still unclear whether or not Drew Brees has fully healed from the rib injury he suffered earlier in the season, and last week's poor outing against the Chiefs seemed to suggest he hasn't. The Saints will also be without Michael Thomas, who has been Brees' go-to guy for a couple seasons now, after he was placed on IR last week due to a reaggravation of the ankle injury he suffered within the first few weeks of the season. Given that the Saints don't have a lot of other weapons besides Alvin Kamara, who has gone 7 straight games without 100 scrimmage yards, this is not good news.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Vikings are also somewhat weakened from last season's wild card game. They have lost Minneapolis Miracle hero Stefon Diggs, and although his replacement, rookie Justin Jefferson, has been balling out, you'd certainly prefer to have Diggs playing in this game with the way his season has gone in Buffalo. Minnesota has also had 3 significant losses at cornerback, with Xavier Rhodes heading to Indy, and Mackensie Alexander and Trae Waynes both in Cincinnati. With those vacancies having to be filled, the 2020 Vikings are now allowing 50 more passing YPG, 30 more rushing YPG, and 11 more PPG than last season.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>As mentioned earlier, this is a key game for both teams with regards to the playoff hunt. The Saints deciding to play Brees last week when he probably wasn't fully healthy is an indication that they fear having to go to Lambeau Field to play the Packers and desperately want the #1 seed, which they can only remain alive for with a win on Friday. New Orleans has also not clinced the division yet, but can do so with a win in either of their final two games (play at Carolina in Week 17). The Vikings are almost done at 6 - 8, and have just a 1.3% chance of making the postseason, meaning they'll need a win and a lot of help if they want to play January football.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Although the lineups are slightly different than in last January's wild card thriller, I think the keys to the game are similar for each team. The Vikings came in as massive underdogs in that matchup, but to their credit, ran the ball well with Dalvin Cook against a very good run defense, and that opened up the play action game for them, which was key in overtime when Kirk Cousins launched a deep ball to Adam Thielen to set Minnesota up for the game winning touchdown. It should also be noted that Cousins has actually played way better than Brees when they have faced off, with the former recording 312 pass YPG, 10 TD, 1 INT, and a 124.4 passer rating, while the latter has just 231 pass YPG, 6 TD, 5 INT, and a 93.5 passer rating in 4 games (both QBs have won 2 each).</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>So for the Vikings to win this game, they will need to establish a solid ground attack first, which I think they should be able to do with Dalvin Cook, who averaged 5.5 yards per carry on 24 attempts last week against a very good Chicago run defense. For the Saints in last year's wild card game, the plan should have been get the ball to Michael Thomas as much as possible, which they didn't. With Michael Thomas now out, Sean Payton has to look to his next best star in Alvin Kamara, who is in consideration for OPOY. The Saints should look to get him going in the ground game and give him a few checkdowns early, but they should also use Latavius Murray in power running situations. Because of the history and because it is Christmas Day, I think this could be quite a physical game, and Murray will also be playing against his former team, which adds extra motivation for him to play well.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Running the football effectively and efficiently is what will be important on Friday, and I think the team that has been able to run the ball better will end up winning. The coaching will have a say in the outcome too, and Sean Payton will be eager to get the better of Mike Zimmer after he was simply out-coached by him in the 2019 wild card game, so expect him to come out with a very solid gameplan. All things considered though, I think the Saints might be just that more desperate for this win, and as such will emerge as victors, but they definitely will not be underestimating this Vikings team after what happened last season.</p>
