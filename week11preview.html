					<p>It's that time of the week again as football Sunday draws ever closer, with Week 11 of the 2020 NFL season set to continue after Thursday nights NFC West duel that saw the Seahawks replace Arizona at the top of the division with a 28 - 21 win over the Cardinals. There are several more exciting matchups set to happen, including a rematch of last seasons divisional round game between the Ravens and Titans, and two very intriguing primetime games to look forward to. Here are some key storylines to look out for on Sunday.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<h3>Taysom Hill starting at QB for the Saints</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Following Drew Brees' injury last week that has now placed him on injured reserve, the Saints announced Friday that Taysom Hill, not Jameis Winston, would be starting for them against the Falcons on Sunday. Hill took all the starter reps in practice, and the team has said Winston will have no part in the offensive gameplan. This is a very interesting decision and a risky one by the Saints. While everybody knows that Jameis Winston is a QB who could easily throw multiple picks in a game, at least you know what you're going to get from him.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>If the former Buccaneers starter were to take the field against Atlanta on Sunday, he'd probably have a 300 yard, 3 TD, 1 INT kind of game, because that's who he is. Hill, on the other hand, is 30 years old and has only thrown 18 passes in his pro career, and he doesn't have a great arm or throwing motion. What we are then likely to see with Hill starting is perhaps a similar offense to a Cam Newton led offense, in that the Saints will dial up a lot of QB draws, option plays, and short to mid-range passes. This could work well because Hill always seems to get yards when he runs, but it's still a risky decision to start a guy like him at QB when he isn't really a QB. Starting Winston would be the better choice in my opinion, because even if he throws a couple picks, you can trust your defense to step up.</p>

					<h3>Battle of the top two picks</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Last week, we saw the #5 overall pick Tua Tagovailoa go head-to-head against the #6 overall pick Justin Herbert, with the former leading his team to a 29 - 21 win. On Sunday, the top two picks in the 2020 draft will now go against each other in a more literal sense, as Joe Burrow and the Bengals take on Chase Young and the Football Team. Burrow has been excellent in his rookie season and is without question one of the frontrunners to win Offensive Rookie of the Year, but Chase Young has been relatively quiet so far.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Expectations for the #2 overall pick out of Ohio State were fairly high, and many people believed he could have an Aaron Donald type impact on games, but we haven't really seen that thus far, with just 3.5 sacks through 9 games. He gets a favorable matchup this week though, against a Bengals offensive line that is not as bad as it was at the start of the season, but still very vulnerable to giving up sacks. If Young managed to dominate that O-line and sack Burrow a couple of times, it would add a lot to his case for Defensive Rookie of the Year, so this is definitely a storyline to watch in Week 11. This is also a big game for Burrow too, as a big performance against Young and this Washington defense would certainly be an additional argument for the Heisman winner to be the OROY.</p>

					<h3>Derrick Henry vs. Ravens again</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Everybody loves a good playoff game rematch, and Week 11 is providing us with just that as the Tennessee Titans travel to Baltimore in a repeat of last seasons divisional round game that saw the Titans emerge as shock winners by a score of 28 - 12. Titans RB Derrick Henry was about as dominant as you can be in that game, with 195 rush yards on 30 carries and a pass TD. The Ravens defense will have to face him again this week, although it seems unlikely that Henry goes off in the same way he did in January.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Coming into that playoff game, Henry had been on an absolute tear and was coming off a 200 yard performance against the Patriots in the previous week. Currently though, the Titans have lost 3 of their last 4 games, and in that stretch Henry has not been all that good. He faced two very good run defenses - the Steelers in Week 7, and the Bears in Week 9 - and against both he was held to well under 100 rush yards, and only 1 TD across the two games. The Ravens have probably the second best run defense in the league behind Pittsburgh, and it is definitely better than it was the last time these two met. With such little momentum coming into the game, I think it will be difficult for Henry to even break 100 rush yards against this good Baltimore run defense.</p>

					<h3>Can the Raiders sweep the Chiefs?</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The Raiders have been one of the surprises of the season at 6 - 3, and nobody is really talking about them either, even though this is by far their best start since 2016 when they finished 12 - 4. The Chiefs, as expected, have been magnificent so far with an 8 - 1 record, but they do have that loss, and who was it to? That's right, the Las Vegas Raiders beat them 40 - 32 in Week 5, marking their first win at Arrowhead in almost 8 years. Patrick Mahomes, in his very young pro career, has never been swept by a divisional opponent and has only lost two games against AFC West teams, but is there a chance the Raiders make it 2 - 0 against Kansas City in 2020 to tighten up things in the division?</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Well, yes, there's always a chance, but it's unfortunately not going to happen for the Raiders. The Chiefs are coming off a bye week and will be very well prepared, and Andy Reid has a terrific career record when coming off a bye. Mahomes is also sizzling hot right now, with 25 TDs and just 1 INT on the season, which is on pace to be the best TD:INT ratio all-time in a single season. Furthermore, the Raiders are missing a few key defensive starters, which I'm sure Mahomes will be licking his lips at. A win for the Chiefs on Sunday night could effectively end the division, as they would be 3 games ahead of the Raiders, which would probably be too much for Las Vegas to make up with just 6 games remaining.</p>

					<h3>Fantasy football pickup of the week</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-1">
					<img src="images/players\pjwalker.png" style="width: 90">
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h3 style="margin-top: 37">PJ Walker, QB, CAR</h3>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Panthers starting QB Teddy Bridgewater looks doubtful to play against the Lions with a knee injury, and if he doesn't, PJ Walker will likely have the role under-center. Walker played in the XFL with the Houston Roughnecks and was easily the league MVP before the rest of the season got cancelled due to COVID-19, as he led his team to a 5 - 0 start. Walker can definitely do some special things with the ball in his hand, and he has a favorable matchup against Detroit this week, so he is a good pickup especially if you lost Drew Brees as your starter.</p>
