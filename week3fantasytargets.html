                <p>Fantasy owners suffered heavily in Week 2 with lengthy injuries to star players such as Saquon Barkley, Courtland Sutton, Christian McCaffrey, and Raheem Mostert. If you were one of the unfortunate ones in your league to get hit with a bad break, then check out 5 great players you can target in Week 3 to get back on track.</p>

		  </div>
		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>With the season-ending injury to star RB Saquon Barkley, the Giants signed Freeman to a one-year deal on Tuesday. Freeman is a great target for your fantasy team, not just for Week 3 but for the rest of the season. He may not see a huge number of snaps this week, because he's just signed with a new team, but by Week 4 he will definitely be the lead back for the Giants. He's great value in PPR leagues as well, because he is a solid pass-catching back that Daniel Jones could be looking to early in games to get him settled. If another owner already has him, then you probably wouldn't have to give up much to trade for him, as he hasn't put up any points so far. Get him now while you can.</p>

		  	</div>	
		  </div>
		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>McKinnon is another player that is going to benefit in the next couple of weeks due to injuries to 49ers RBs Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman. He rushed just 3 times for 77 yards and a TD against the Jets in Week 2, but 22 of San Francisco's other rushing attempts went to Mostert and Coleman, so expect McKinnon to get the majority of the workload in the backfield. He has a great matchup against the Giants this week, plus with primary QB Jimmy G sidelined for the moment, the 49ers offense will definitely look to run more.</p>

		  	</div>	
		  </div>
		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Gage may only be the third option at WR in Atlanta, but he's a great pickup for your team for several reasons. Firstly, the Falcons offense is very pass-heavy, because of their inconsistent ground attack, so Matt Ryan will be targeting Gage 10 aroundtimes per game. Secondly, primary WR Julio Jones appears to be playing through a hamstring injury that saw him get only 2 catches against the Cowboys in Week 2, so if the injury gets any more serious for Jones, it would see Gage get even more targets. With Jones and Calvin Ridley as the main guys for the Falcons, Gage is still averaging over 18 PPG in PPR leagues, so don't hesitate to start him.</p>

		  	</div>	
		  </div>
		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Yet another player who's going to see their production increase due to the injury of another teammate, as primary TE CJ Uzomah is out for the season in Cincinnati. Sample had 7 catches on 9 targets for the Bengals against Cleveland in Week 2, which was a tied team high with WR Tyler Boyd. The TE position in fantasy can often be quite unreliable, and this pickup would definitely be a risk, but a big upside for Sample is that the Bengals could often find themselves down in games because of their poor defense, meaning a pass-heavy gameplan. He also has a good matchup this week against the Eagles, who gave up 3 TDs to LA Rams TE Tyler Higbee in Week 2.</p>

		  	</div>	
		  </div>
		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Derek Carr has been dishing out dimes to his receivers so far in 2020, especially on Monday night against a very good Saints defense. His chemistry with Darren Waller at the moment is something similar to that between Pat Mahomes and Travis Kelce. This could be a really good addition if you're struggling at the QB position at the moment, particularly for fantasy owners of Tom Brady and Drew Brees, who have not put up big numbers thus far. Carr faces a tough Patriots defense this week, but a defense that Russell Wilson was able to carve up in Week 2. A good pick as a starter, and a great pick as a backup.</p>
