				<p>After COVID-19 finally hit the NFL in Week 4, causing a mouthwatering Steelers-Titans clash to be moved to Week 7, the league has so far made it to Sunday of Week 5 without any games having to be rescheduled to later weeks. Two games initally set for Sunday did have to be postponed however, with the Broncos-Patriots game moved to an early evening 5:00PM ET kickoff on Monday, and the Bills-Titans matchup getting rescheduled to Tuesday night, meaning an NFL game on a Tuesday for only the second time in 70 years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<p>Week 5 began on Thursday night, with a great matchup on TNF (finally) as the 3 - 1 Buccaneers hoped to extend their division lead against the 3 - 1 Bears. It was a QB rematch of Super Bowl LII, as Tom Brady and Nick Foles went head-to-head for the first time since that incredible game in Minnesota, and it was Foles that came out on top again as he led Chicago to a 20 - 19 win, to keep pace with the 4 - 0 Green Bay Packers in the NFC North. 11 more games are scheduled for Sunday, so here's everything you need to know for each one, including fantasy starts and sits, and things to look out for. (NOTE: Fantasy starts and sits do not include superstars such as Mahomes, Hopkins, Lamar Jackson etc. as they are always obvious starts).</p>

				<p>Well done to you if you thought the Texans would have a worse record than the Jaguars through 4 weeks of the 2020 NFL season. Although they've had a tough schedule (Chiefs, Ravens, Steelers, Vikings), Houston has been very disappointing in that they haven't been desperately close to winning in any of those games. This is by far their easiest opponent thus far, with the Jaguars on a 3 game losing streak and no sign of anything positive in last week's loss to the Bengals. The firing of Bill O'Brien shortly after the Texans' loss to the Vikings could act as extra motivation for the Houston players as they get the sense that they 'could be next', so it will probably make them play better, particularly given the fact the interim HC is someone they are all familiar with, Romeo Crennel. This week should be the week that the Texans get win number 1.</p>

				<p>The Arizona Cardinals have slipped up in their last couple of games, losing to the Panthers and Lions, who both had worse records when they played them. They shuld be able to get back on track here, although it is the classic case of a West Coast team travelling East for what is essentially a 10:00AM PT kickoff for Arizona, so that could factor in and make this game closer than it should be. There's also a change at QB for the Jets, as veteran Joe Flacco comes in to replace the injured Sam Darnold. This could improve the Jets offense because it can't get much worse from what Darnold has been able to do. Le'Veon Bell is back too for the Jets, after they activated him off IR on Saturday. With all of that taken into account, it is not a foregone conclusion that the Cardinals win this game.</p>

Despite a laboring win over the Newton-less Patriots on Monday, the Chiefs are still the best team in football, while the Raiders are on the decline having lost 2 in a row. It should be nothing less than a comfortable win for Mahomes and the gang, and watch out for this high octane offense to break the 40 point mark, something they have been able to do a lot recently against the Raiders.</p>

				<p>Joe Burrow got his first win as a pro last week against the Jaguars, but this is going to be all sorts of different as he goes up against a scary Ravens defense. Lamar Jackson has a 7 - 1 career record against AFC North opponents, losing only to the Browns last year, meaning the reigning MVP has a perfect record against Cincinnati. Not only that, but this is the team that he did his incredible juking, spinning, and ankle-breaking run against last year, so look out for some similar fireworks from him. Despite the obvious mismatch in almost all areas of the game here though, the Bengals have been able to keep every game close so far, with each one being decided by one possession (lost by 3, lost by 5, tie, won by 8), so don't be surprised if Burrow has a chance to win it at the end. If he did, it would bring the Bengals to .500, which could be good for a playoff spot in the AFC.</p>

				<p>The Steelers haven't played a game in two weeks, so what does that mean for how they're going to perform against Philadelphia? Will there be some rustiness, or will the extra preparation time pay off? Probably the latter, because unlike the Titans, who were Pittsburgh's opponents for the rescheduled Week 7 game, the Steelers have been able to hold actual practices as they had no positive COVID tests. Their defense will probably come out as sharp as ever, and could absolutely decimate the Eagles' offensive line. Carson Wentz is coming off the back of an okay performance against the 49ers that got the Eagles their first win, but he's going to need a lot more magic to pull a W out of the hat against Pittsburgh. The Eagles actually have a 47 - 28 - 3 all-time record against their PA rivals, but this week's game is a tough ask.</p>

				<p>A classic NFC South bout as the Panthers, on a 2 game win streak, travel to the Falcons, on a 4 game losing streak. Despite how hot the Panthers are and how ice cold the Falcons are, this is actually a good matchup for Atlanta to try and salvage something out of this season. Matt Ryan and Dan Quinn have always performed well against Carolina, winning 8 of the last 9 meetings. The strange part is, Atlanta would be 2 - 2 in 2020 if they could hold on to a 16+ point lead in the fourth quarter, which would make this an even more intriguing game to watch. This is not just a big game for Atlanta's season though, it's also a big game for HC Dan Quinn. If the Falcons lose, he will probably get fired on Monday. A lot on the line for Atlanta, and for that reason, the Falcons will win in a shootout.</p>

				<p>Dwayne Haskins was officially benched by Washington HC Ron Rivera just 4 weeks into the season, meaning Kyle Allen will get the starting job with veteran Alex Smith as backup. Rivera and Allen know each other well from their time together in Carolina, so Washington's offense may start to look a little bit nicer this week, although it will be a tall order against a tough Rams defense. The Rams barely beat the Giants last week, winning just 17 - 9, and this week's game could go in a similar direction, as in it could be quite close. Washington doesn't have a bad defense necessarily, however the Rams have scored 34.5 PPG on the road this season, which is second in the league behind only the Packers. So if the Football Team want to win this game, they'll have to score a bunch.</p>

				<p>It's early in the season but with the way the NFC West is going, this almost feels like a must-win game for the 49ers if they want to win the division. If they lose, and the Seahawks win, they'll be 3 games back, which is a lot to make up against Russell Wilson, particularly in a regular season that could be shortened by COVID. The good news for San Francisco though is it appears that they'll have Jimmy Garoppolo back at QB, rather than Nick Mullens who was very shaky last week against Philadelphia. For the Dolphins, it feels like there's pressure building for them to give rookie 5th overall pick Tua Tagovailoa a go at QB, so maybe a loss this week will trigger Brian Flores to sit Fitzpatrick and allow Tua to start in Week 6.</p>

There are so many issues with Dallas, most notably their defense and their inability to keep hold of the football. They should be able to beat the Giants, because the Giants have struggled in every game so far, and will continue to do so without Saquon Barkley. If and when the Cowboys do take the lead on Sunday though, they'll be entering relatively unfamiliar territory for them this season, as they have had the lead on just 7 of their 313 offensive snaps in 2020. If they were in any other division, the season would basically be over for them.</p>

A sizzling hot Browns offense, that has put up 30+ points in 3 straight games including 49 last week in Dallas, faces off against an incredibly tight Colts defense that has allowed fewer than 12 points in 3 straight games. This is going to be a big challenge for Baker Mayfield and Cleveland, but if the former #1 overall pick can lead this team from Ohio to a win, people may start saying nice things about him. The Browns will be without Nick Chubb though, who suffered an injury last week against the Cowboys, but Kareem Hunt should have no problem carrying over the workload. Look out for Myles Garrett to be a big force in this game too against the Colts O-line, because even if Indy's defense can hold the Browns to under 20, their offense will still have to score to win, and Garrett could stop that from happening.</p>

Wilson has connected with David Moore, DK Metcalf, and Tyler Lockett on several over-the-top deep throws that are practically inevitable this week. This receiving corps against this secondary is one of the biggest mismatches of the week, and it's going to cost Minnesota, even if their offense manages to put up 30+ points which they easily could do, as Seattle's defense has allowed around 400 passing yards per game in 2020. There is a potential for an upset here, but it's going to have to be down to Kirk Cousins keeping up with Russell Wilson and the Seahawks offense, which is something that probably won't happen, especially given Cousins' poor primetime record.</p>
