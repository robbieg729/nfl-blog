				<p>These two AFC South teams split the season series last year, but the way things have gone in 2020, the Titans are heavy favorites for this matchup. Tennessee is 1 of just 2 remaining undefeated teams in the AFC (Pittsburgh Steelers), and have a big chance to stay unbeaten on Sunday. Ryan Tannehill has been playing lights out all season with 9 pass TDs and 1 INT, and has established a dangerous rapport with TE Jonnu Smith. The Texans meanwhile have looked lost without Hopkins this year, although there is some hope that Watson has found a new favorite receiver after Brandin Cooks went for 8 catches for 161 yards and a TD in last week's win over Jacksonville. All the evidence points to an easy win for Tennessee, but it is a division game and the Titans are coming off a short week having played on Tuesday night.</p>

				<p>A battle of two of the most disappointing teams so far this season, with just 1 combined win in 2020. The big news is that Dalvin Cook is out for this game, meaning Alexander Mattison will take over as the primary back for the Vikings. This does not necessarily mean that the Vikings run game will be any weaker against this Falcons D, as Mattison practically bullied the Seahawks run defense on Sunday night in Week 5, so he is a definite start for fantasy owners. The Falcons will be playing their first game since Dan Quinn was fired as HC, with Raheem Morris taking over as interim, and this makes things even more difficult for Atlanta to post their first win. The Vikings should be favored here at home.</p>

				<p>The battle for the second overall pick in next year's draft starts in Week 6 with this matchup right here. Someone is going to get a win after 9 straight combined losses between the Giants and the Football Team, and if it's Washington who wins, they may go first in the NFC East. There are a lot of problems for both teams coming into this game though. The Football Team have lost all 4 games this season by 14+, while Daniel Jones hasn't even thrown a pass TD since Week 1 against Pittsburgh. It almost feels like neither team is going to win with the streaks they're on, although the Giants did look okay against Dallas last week, so they will probably get their first win of 2020.</p>

It should be noted that the Lions' 1 - 3 record may be a bit deceiving, given that they are the only team in the league whose opponents this season all have winning records (ARI, GB, CHI, NO).</p>

				<p>It's only Week 6 but this is such an important game for both teams, as it could dictate who the main threats are to Baltimore's AFC North title. There are so many good matchups within this game to look out for, including Pittsburgh's incredible run defense against Cleveland's league best run offense, and Myles Garrett's excellent pass rush against a good Steelers offensive line. The biggest factor in this game though is that Steelers run D, because it's going to have to force Baker Mayfield to throw the ball more, something which doesn't usually favor the Browns. History says the Steelers will win too, as Ben Roethlisberger is 22 - 2 - 1 all time against the Browns, and 24 - 2 at home in the month of October.</p>

				<p>Joe Burrow and the Bengals have been dealt a tough draw here, having to face the Ravens D and Colts D on the road in consecutive weeks. The Bengals and Colts offenses rank 22nd and 20th in the league respectively, so they are about even there, but the big disparity comes with the Bengals' 25th ranked defense and the Colts' 2nd ranked defense. It's going to be extremely difficult for Joe Mixon to get anything going on the ground, and the Bengals offensive line could struggle against the pass rush of Deforrest Buckner. The Colts should win comfortably and keep pace with the Titans in the division. The only way the Bengals win this game is if their defense steps up, which could happen as Philip Rivers is a very interception prone QB.</p>

				<p>This is one of the best matchups of the week, as the Panthers, on a 3 game win streak, host the Bears, who have won 4 of 5 games this season. On paper, the Panthers have the edge with a 5th ranked offense and a 17th ranked defense against a 23rd ranked offense and a 14th ranked defense, but Chicago's excellent secondary could very well stall Teddy B and Robby Anderson in this game. This will probably be quite a low scoring affair and could come down to a big defensive play made by either team to decide the game, especially since all of Chicago's games in 2020 have come down to one score. The Panthers have a chance here to go top of the NFC South after 6 weeks, which not a lot of people would have predicted.</p>

				<p>This was the game that was meant to be played last week but was postponed to Week 6 thanks to COVID. There is a lot of bad news for Denver, most notably that both Noah Fant and Melvin Gordon will be inactive for this game, while Super Cam is back for the Pats. Both of these teams have top 5 defenses, but the Broncos rank last on offense in the NFL, including last in rushing and last in passing. That's going to be their undoing on Sunday because there is no way that Bill Belichick allows a 32nd ranked offense to beat his defense, and there is a feeling that it could be hard for the Broncos to contain Cam Newton.</p>

The Jets should just decide right now that they want to tank for Trevor Lawrence, because he is a star and could actually bring some life into this organization.

				<p>Rodgers vs. Brady part 3! The Packers are unquestionably the hottest team in the NFL right now - they've played 4 games, won 4 games, and have 30+ points and 0 giveaways in each week. Aaron Rodgers has played MVP type football in the first month, and has shown he is clearly the better QB between him and Brady, though Sunday's game could certainly have an impact on that debate if the Bucs win. The big news for the Packers is that Davante Adams is back, although Rodgers barely needed him during his absence, but it could be a key factor given that Aaron Jones may not have a lot of yards on the ground, as the Bucs defense has allowed fewer than 50 rush yards in 3 straight games. The Packers are simply on too much of a roll to lose this game though.</p>
