				<p>The second of two NFC East matchups in Week 7, with the Eagles defeating the Giants 22 - 21 on TNF. The Cowboys were just awful against the Cardinals on MNF last week, and it's extremely worrying that their go-to guy, Zeke Elliott, can't seem to keep ahold of the football. Luckily this week they face a Washington team that has lost 5 straight and is really struggling on offense, which definitely suits Dallas as they don't look like they can score many points at the moment either. Dallas has won 7 of the last 8 against Washington, but with Andy Dalton having to QB the Cowboys, against a Football Team defense that has allowed 207 passing YPG in 2020, there really is 0 certainty of them winning.</p>

				<p>It is a flat out guarantee that Aaron Rodgers is going to destroy the Houston defense that he will face this week. A lot was said about him during the week, specifically about how he is a 'quitter' when his team is down big like they were against the Bucs last weekend. Rodgers is the type of guy who will take that on the chin and just ball out in the next game, and the fact that he's facing a 31st ranked defense just makes that even more likely. There's a lot of numbers that say Green Bay will win this game too. They haven't lost consecutive games since Week 13 of the 2018 season, and Aaron Rodgers has never had consecutive games with 0 pass TDs in his entire career. The Pack will get back on track.</p>

				<p>Teddy B will face his former team for the first time this week as he takes his Panthers to the Superdome. This matchup last season saw a 34 - 31 win for the Saints, with Will Lutz kicking the game winning field goal, and Sunday's game should follow a similar trend. Although the Saints have the 2nd total defense in the league, they have allowed 20+ fantasy PPG to QBs in every game this season (which is why you should start Teddy B if you have him), while Carolina's pass defense ranks 4th in the league, going up against a less-than-par Drew Brees in 2020. Even better for the Panthers D is that Emmanuel Sanders and Michael Thomas are both officially out for Sunday's game, so Brees will be without some of his favorite weapons and could struggle.</p>

				<p>The Bills have been poor in their last 2 games against the Titans and Chiefs, but this is the perfect game for them, particularly Josh Allen, to starting to feeling good again. The Jets just have nothing going for them right now, and the last thing their fans would want to see is a win for their team, because it would just mean Adam Gase gets to keep his job for one more week. Sam Darnold will make his return this week barring any setbacks on Sunday, but it really isn't much of an improvement from Joe Flacco. Josh Allen is going to rip apart the Jets, and I think Buffalo's defense gets a confidence boost by holding their opponent to less than 10 points this week.</p>

After getting benched for Case Keenum in last week's 38 - 7 rout by Pittsburgh, if he loses to this Bengals team that will be without Joe Mixon and has a lot of issues on defense, he may well lose the starting job for good. The clock is ticking for him, and he's been dealt an untimely blow with TE Austin Hooper declared out with appendicitis. Mayfield is 4 - 1 in his career against the Bengals though, with the only loss coming in an irrelevant Week 17 game to end the 2019 season. Can Baker save his job?</p>

				<p>3 of the last 4 games between these two teams have come down to one score, and you can expect a similar outcome on Sunday. Don't expect it to be a low scoring 16 - 13 game though, there will be fireworks in this one. Both the Lions and Falcons scored 34+ points in their last games, and they're both going against defenses who have allowed a lot of points in 2020, which is why you should start virtually every offensive player you have from Detroit and Atlanta in fantasy. The Falcons were revived last week after Dan Quinn's firing, but the Lions have won 2 of their last 3. Tough to pick a winner here.</p>

				<p>A COVID-19 reschedule gives us what could be one of the games of the season in Week 7, with the AFC's last two remaining undefeated teams going head-to-head. Derrick Henry, off the back of a 200+ yard rushing day against the Texans, will find nothing easy on Sunday as he faces the Steelers' top ranked defense in the NFL. It is majorly important that the Steelers manage to withstand Henry somewhat, because if they can, the play action game that Tannehill lives off may not be as effective, which will give Pittsburgh a big advantage. But just because they have the best run defense in the NFL, does that mean they can stop the beast that is Derrick Henry? I don't think so, but the good news for Pittsburgh is that the Titans will be without OT Taylor Lewan, which could slow down the running game a bit. That's where this game will be won and lost.</p>

				<p>This game was flexed from SNF to make way for the epic Russell Wilson-Kyler Murray showdown, but it still has all the makings of a primetime matchup. Raiders coach Jon Gruden will be facing Tampa Bay for the first time since he led them to a Super Bowl in 2003, so there's a little extra in it for him. His team could have a tough time though against a defense that dominated Aaron Rodgers last week, and it's not like the Raiders can then rely on the ground game to get them going because Tampa Bay's run defense is one of the best in the league, holding Aaron Jones to just 15 rush yards in Week 6. Derek Carr will probably have to look to Darren Waller a lot in order for them to win this game, but it is a tall order.</p>

				<p>Two teams who are seeking their first win since Week 1, with a combined 9 straight losses between them. This should be a walk in the park for the Chargers though, with Justin Herbert playing lights out football since his debut against the Chiefs. If he can throw 4 TD passes against an excellent Saints defense in primetime, what do you think is going to happen against a 29th ranked Jags defense in a 4:25PM ET kickoff? I expect that the Chargers will get off to a blistering start, forcing Minshew to throw the ball more which he hasn't looked comfortable doing the past few weeks. It will probably be a similar game to last week's loss to the Lions.</p>

				<p>A revenge game for Jimmy G as he faces the Patriots for the first time since they traded him to the 49ers. This is a very tough game to call because the 49ers played excellent last week, and despite the fact that the Patriots were very poor, it's unlikely that Belichick allows his team to have 2 straight bad games. That said though, this is a tough matchup for the 27th ranked Patriots offense versus an 11th ranked 49ers defense, and it's important to note that Cam Newton's passer rating has gone down significantly with each game this season. A bright spot for New England is that the 49ers will be without Mostert, who was really electric against the Rams and effectively got them off to a hot offensive start.</p>

				<p>It doesn't really feel like the Broncos have won 2 straight because of COVID reschedules and what not, but they have. Unfortunately, that streak is coming to an end, as they have way too tough of a game against the Chiefs. Although Denver is a hard place to play in with the altitude, Mahomes has never really struggled against the Broncos in his career, with just the first game being close. All the number suggest a Chiefs win too. KC is the only team in the league in the top 10 for both pass YPG (276.7) and rush YPG (140.3), and they have won 9 straight against Denver. Despite Le'Veon Bell being eligible to play, I expect Clyde Edwards-Helaire to get the majority of the snaps after his 161 yard rushing day at the Bills.</p>

				<p>Russell Wilson is 6 - 1 - 1 at Arizona in his career, but he is going to have to fight extremely hard to get a 7th win. Arizona's defense played exceptionally against the Cowboys, particularly S Budda Baker. Obviously there is a difference between Andy Dalton and Russell Wilson, but that Cardinals defense is definitely legit, even without Chandler Jones. Interestingly enough, Arizona is better ranked than Seattle in offense, defense, passing, and rushing, and the passing game could be something to watch as the Seahawks secondary has really struggled to keep WRs in check in 2020, which is not ideal when facing DeAndre Hopkins. This game should definitely be on upset alert, and despite the Cardinals coming off a short week and the Seahawks coming off a bye, history says this is actually advantageous for Arizona - since 1990, teams with 5 or fewer rest days are 32 - 17 against teams with 10+ days of rest.</p>
