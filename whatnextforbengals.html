				<div class="col">
					<p>For a lot of people, sports provides a welcoming distraction to everyday life, especially in a year like 2020, with the return of major leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB offering a sense of normality that has been hard to find during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sports is a necessary part of life, but boy it can be cruel. Yesterdays game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Football Team provided a moment that proved just that, as Bengals QB, #1 overall pick, and national treasure in college Joe Burrow suffered a gruesome leg injury that an MRI later revealed to be a torn ACL, effectively ending Burrows rookie season there and then.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The incident occurred early in the second half, with the Bengals leading 9 - 7. With 203 passing yards and 1 TD on the day already, Burrow took a shotgun snap on 3rd and 2 at the Bengals own 10 yard line, and was hit low as he released a pass in the direction of Tyler Boyd that ended up incomplete. The Heisman Trophy winner was immediately holding his left leg and appeared to be in a substantial amount of pain. That would be the last play Burrow was involved in for the day, and the season for that matter, as he was carted off the field as both sidelines emptied to show love to the top pick in the 2020 draft.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>The NFL community showed its support for Burrow, with numerous players and former players including Patrick Mahomes, Russell Wilson, and Chad Ochocinco offering messages of condolence on social media. Lost in all the devastation though was the irony of the situation. Only two years ago, on the same week of the season, on the same field, Alex Smith, who was the starting QB for Washington yesterday, suffered a similar injury that kept him out of the league for almost 2 year, as he made just his first start since that day last week against Detroit.</p>

				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Even though the Bengals were well out of playoff contention with a 2 - 6 - 1 record coming into the week, their remaining schedule was not all that hard, and with Burrow playing the way he had, they could have easily gone 5 - 2 to build some momentum heading into 2021. It appears now though that their season really is over, but there are still 6 games to play before their offseason can begin. The question is, what do they do with the rest of this season, with the heart and soul of the franchise now out indefinitely?</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Ryan Finley replaced Burrow at QB yesterday, and it's likely that the Bengals will roll with him until the remainder of the season. Finley went just 3/10 for 30 yards and 1 INT, in what was not his first on field action for Cincinnati. Finley played 3 times for them last season, when Andy Dalton was benched after an 0 - 8 start, making him the first QB in NFL history to start a season 8 - 0, and start another season 0 - 8. In that 3 game stretch, Finley recorded 474 passing yards, 2 TDs, and 2 INTs, for an overall rating of 62.7. Hardly convincing, although given that the Bengals were able to draft Burrow the following April, it didn't seem relevant.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It's hard to see the Bengals winning another game this season with Finley under center. The offense just doesn't click with Finley like it did with Burrow, and the defense definitely isn't coming to save them. If they don't win another game, they will finish with a 2 - 13 - 1 record, which will likely be good for the #3 overall draft pick, which is actually very significant. Coming into Week 11, Burrow was one of the most hit and sacked QBs in the entire league, and the main reason is because of how poor the Bengals offensive line is, which is no surprise given that they didn't really do much to address it in the offseason. If they get a top 3 draft pick though, that is their chance to address it.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It's hard to fault the Bengals drafting Tee Higgins with their second round pick in 2020 because the chemistry between he and Burrow has been insane and desperately needed with the linkup between Burrow and AJ Green not working as well as expected. A lot of people thought the Bengals would and should draft an offensive lineman in the 2020 draft, especially given how deep that class was. They didn't, they waited until the sixth round to take one in Hakeem Adeniji, and this is the consequence. But now, they get a top 3 pick in the 2021 draft, and they have to take a lineman. They'll probably get the best one too with the Jets and Jaguars (currently #1 and #2 in the draft order) unlikely to draft at that position.</p>

				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>That won't be enough though. The Bengals need to look elsewhere for an offensive lineman and there are several options available to them. One is to trade away AJ Green for potentially another first round pick, or make an offer that will in some way get them an offensive lineman with current NFL experience. It would be hard to trade away AJ Green because he has been a terrific receiver for this franchise, and unfortunately injury seems to have robbed him of a better career, but now this franchise is all Joe Burrow, and you have to do everything you can to protect him and ensure nothing like yesterday happens again.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Another thing the front office may want to look at is Zac Taylor. There have been some suggestions around the league that he is on the hot seat. With Burrows injury though, he will likely get the benefit of the doubt because it's hard to work with a QB as inexperienced as Ryan Finley. Additionally, Burrow and Taylor seem like a good fit together. Watching the Bengals offense this season has actually been very intriguing. They're always able to move the ball down the field very methodically, and Taylor has made some excellent calls in big time situations, as the Bengals were 14/17 on 4th downs for the season with Burrow. Taylor should keep his job, because that's not where the problem lies. The front office has to go out and get some help on the O-line, and on defense too.</p>
