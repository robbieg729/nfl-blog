					<p>The Offensive Rookie of the Year Award (OROY) is a coveted prize given to the best performing offensive rookie in a given season the night before the Super Bowl. Last year, it was won by 2019 #1 overall pick Kyler Murray, who has done nothing but shine since his pro debut against the Lions in September of last year. Through 7 weeks of the 2020 season, it is pretty clear that there are only 2 suitable candidates for this year's award: Bengals QB and #1 overall pick Joe Burrow, and Chargers QB and #6 overall pick Justin Herbert.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Coming into the season, many people thought Burrow would cruise to the OROY award, mainly because there were doubts about when other first-round QBs like Justin Herbert and Tua Tagovailoa would even be getting a chance to play. Since Tyrod Taylor's chest injury prior to the Chargers' Week 2 game versus the Chiefs however, Justin Herbert has been a spectacle to watch, and is giving Burrow some fierce competition for the OROY award. Both have put up some record-breaking numbers in the first half of the season, but who has the edge?</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>There are 2 important things to consider in this debate: stats, and circumstances. Let's start with Burrow. Joe Burrow is playing with just about the worst offensive line in the league, making him vulnerable to a lot of hits. He's also got a head coach in Zac Taylor who really has yet to prove himself in his second season, and could be on the hot seat sometime soon if the Bengals keep losing in these tight one-score games. Burrow also doesn't have much of a run game to take some of the load off his shoulders, which is resulting in him having to throw the ball 40, 50, or even 60 times a game. For a rookie QB with a bad offensive line, that is a tough ask.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>But Burrow has irrefutably risen to the challenge so far. He ranks third in the league in passing yards (2023), has scored 12 total TDs (9 passing, 3 rushing), and Pro Football Focus (PFF) ranks him second in the league on throws less than 20 yards downfield with a 90+ grade. Burrow is also on pace to break 2 of Andrew Luck's rookie records. The #1 overall pick is currently projected to throw for 4624 passing yards which would comfortably eclipse Luck's mark of 4374 set in 2012, and Burrow now has 5 games of 300+ passing yards - Luck's record is 6.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Just think about that - the record for 300+ passing yard games by a rookie is 6, and Burrow has 5 through 7 games with a terrible offensive line. His ability to hang in there and keep making plays despite the number of times he gets hit and gets asked to throw the football is quite something. His Week 2 game against the Browns, also his primetime debut, was a classic example of this, as Zac Taylor made him throw the ball 61 times, completing 37 of them for 316 yards, 3 TDs, and 0 picks despite getting hit time and time again by the Browns D-line. Whether or not Burrow wins OROY this season, the Bengals have their guy, that is for sure.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Now over to Justin Herbert. As impressive as Burrow has been, Herbert has arguably been better. Everyone knew coming in that Herbert had a cannon for a deep ball, but sometimes in a QB's rookie season that doesn't quite translate to the NFL, and it hasn't quite yet for Burrow. For Herbert on the other hand, he's shown that he is not afraid of slinging it downfield, and his 4 TD performance on MNF (the first ever by a rookie in MNF history) against the Saints was fantastic to watch despite the loss.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>In terms of the circumstances for Herbert, he also does not have a great offensive line, but he does have a more experienced coach and finds himself in a a better organization in general. This does not take anything away from Herbert's play so far because it has been terrific, but it is something that voters will take into account when they submit their ballot for the OROY award, and any award in fact. So Herbert is probably in a slightly better situation overall in terms of the organization and the coaching staff he has, but it is also important to note that Burrow knew from the moment the Bengals drafted him that he would be playing Week 1 against the Chargers, while Herbert had about 3 seconds notice before being put in to face a Super Bowl winning defense in the Chiefs in Week 2. And he performed magnificently in that game, and did enough to send it to OT against Patrick Mahomes.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>Keeping with Mahomes for a second, Herbert just recently joined the Super Bowl LIV MVP as only the second ever QB to throw for 250+ passing yards in each of his first 5 games. Not bad company for the former Oregon Duck. Herbert has also thrown for 1542 yards in total, has 14 total TDs (12 passing, 2 rushing), and has a PFF grade of 75.8 (Burrow has a 74.6 grade). Keep in mind that the volume stats are through 5 games too (bye week plus didn't start Week 1), which is 2 games less than Burrow has played.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>So statistically speaking, Herbert has the edge and has looked more impressive so far, but when you add in the context, it does get closer. What is also important to note is that it's not always the player with the better season who will win the award. If Joe Burrow has an impressive season, he's likely to get more votes even if Herbert has a better one, because he is the #1 overall pick and because of the circumstances Burrow faces with the terrible organization he finds himself in and the offensive line he has, which is now severely banged up after last week's loss to the Browns, though the Bengals are expected to sign former Bills guard Quinton Spain to help protect Burrow.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>It's also only Week 8 and these two QBs have plenty more games to get through, and of course how you play can often depend on who you're playing. Looking at their remaining games, the strength of schedules (SOS) come out about the same, but both probably have slightly easier matchups ahead of them than they have had in their first few weeks. Burrow's is probably slightly tougher as he still has to face the Steelers twice, and also the Ravens one more time in Week 17, which could be a defining game for Burrow to see if he can play much better against the tough Baltimore defense than he did in Week 5, assuming the Ravens play all their starters, which they likely will given how close the AFC North is looking to be.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>If the season ended now just before Week 8, Burrow would probably get the majority of the votes but it would be very close. Herbert definitely has had the better season statistically so far, but it's hard to overlook the situation Burrow is in and the fact that despite his coaching staff is putting him in some real bad spots during games, he's still competing at a high level and is the reason the Bengals have found themselves in many close games this season. If Herbert continues to light up defenses as he has been so far this season though, a lot of people may find it hard to vote against him in January or February, regardless of what Burrow does. One thing is for sure though - these are two QBs who have had excellent starts to their pro career, and who will most likely be performing at a very high level for a long time to come.</p>
