                <p>Every season in the NFL, Week 2 is looked at as a pivotal moment for most teams as they try to avoid an 0 - 2 start, which historically doesn't bode well for your playoff chances. The statistics say that since the merger in 1970, just 12% of teams who have started a season 0 - 2 have ended up making the playoffs in that same season. This year, it's more like 15%, because of that extra playoff spot in each conference, but most teams would rather go 1 - 1 than tempt fate with that extra 3%. After two weeks of the 2020 season, there are 11 winless teams. How can each of them battle back to save their season?</p>

		  		<p>The Texans have been dealt a really nasty schedule to start the season, losing badly to the Chiefs and Ravens (the likely top seeds in the AFC) in their first two games, and now face a tough road trip to Pittsburgh to take on an excellent Steelers defense. They really weren't able to compete in Week 1 or 2, which is disappointing given that they have one of the most exciting and dynamic QBs in the league in Deshaun Watson, and I think he's their key to getting some wins. He has to make some electric plays similar to ones we saw last season, because he hasn't been able to do that so far, which means the Texans aren't really getting many redzone opportunities. WR Brandin Cooks is also a key player I feel in somewhat replacing the Watson-Hopkins connection, so they need to target him more.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Philadelphia has just looked terrible so far, and there's a lot of things they need to fix in order to make another run at the playoffs. Firstly, Carson Wentz has to play better. He has really struggled so far, and although a lot of that can be attributed to the offensive line allowing defenders through easily, Wentz has never really had a great offensive line and he's been able to take the Eagles far in previous seasons. An interesting stat is that over the past 3 seasons, Wentz is 7 - 15 against teams that are not the Giants or Washington. Secondly, the defense has to do a much better job of giving Wentz a chance to win the ball game. In Week 1, the Eagles offense definitely let the game slip, but against the Rams in Week 2, Wentz brought it back to a one score game late, only for the Rams to pour in 13 quick points to seal the game. Lastly, they have to get lucky with injuries which they haven't the past few seasons.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>The Falcons have one of the better rosters in the NFL, but they just haven't been able to click so far. Blowing a 20 point lead is inexcusable, but at least this team is doing what they're best at. The one thing that can help you stop a team from making a last second comeback, running the ball, is one of the things the Falcons can't do effectively. They have a solid RB in Todd Gurley, a guy who had 21 TDs overall in the 2018 season with the Rams, but he is getting stuffed virtually every time he gets the handoff. That and majorly improving their defense are the two things the Falcons need to look into before their tough Week 3 game against the Bears.</p>

		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>The Vikings offense actually looked okay in their Week 1 game against a good Packers defense, scoring 34 points, but they put up more of a brick than that Paul George side-of-the-backboard shot in Week 2. This team definitely misses Diggs as a primary downfield threat, but their defense is a bigger problem. Their secondary is made up of extremely young and inexperienced players, as they gave up two DBs to the Bengals and Xavier Rhodes to the Colts. I think the front office has to go out and acquire a solid and consistent DB from somewhere, because otherwise the Vikings offense is going to have to keep playing from behind, which is never easy, especially with a lack of downfield threats as previously mentioned. Last season people were talking about the fact that Kirk Cousins can't play in primetime, well I don't think he can play at all. He has to step up his game for this Vikings team to have any chance.</p>

		  </div>
		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Getting back into playoff contention for the Broncos is a really tough ask now that Drew Lock is sidelined for 2 weeks minimum, and also because their Pro Bowl receiver Courtland Sutton's season is done with an ACL tear. Hopefully Lock can come back as soon as possible, because although Blake Bortles, who the Broncos have just signed and will presumably start, is not good enough to lead this team to the playoffs. There really isn't a lot else to be said for Denver. Their defense is playing well and gave them a chance to win against the Steelers without Lock, and held the Titans to just 16 points in Week 1. A little more consistency from the running game is probably their best hope of getting some Ws while Lock is out.</p>

		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>The Lions should probably be 1 - 1, but as it is they're not, and they face a bit of an uphill battle to make the playoffs because the NFC is so stacked and if you haven't won at least 1 game yet, you're in trouble. Defensively Detroit is going to struggle this season and I think everyone knew that coming in, but I do feel that Matt Stafford is a good enough QB and has a good enough supporting cast to keep games close and make fourth quarter comebacks, which is his signature move. The Lions were unlucky in the first 2 weeks of the season with primary WR Kenny Golladay out, and they definitely would have beaten the Bears with him in the lineup. When he comes back, I think they'll be able to compete more, and that's really what they have to do - stay in the game and give Stafford a chance to win it.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Joe Burrow can consider himself unlucky (though he probably won't) that he isn't at least 1 - 1 right now, because he's played well for a rookie QB with no preseason. There's two main things this team has to do though to try and make a run at the playoffs, and the first involves Burrow. He targeted AJ Green 13 times against the Browns in Week 2, but only 3 passes were completed, and I think that connection has to improve massively for Cincinnati to have success, because Green can be a serious playmaker. Secondly, they need to get that run defense sorted out. It was awful against Cleveland, and if they had managed to make a stop when it was 23-28, Burrow easily could have led a game winning drive. AJ and defense. That's it.</p>

		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Teddy Bridgewater was a really nice pickup for the Panthers in the offseason, and he has a lot of nice weapons to get the ball to. They have had a tough schedule so far in all honesty, playing a hot Raiders team in Week 1 and then Brady and the Bucs in Week 2, so this 0 - 2 start might not be a great indication of where this team is at. However, Christian McCaffrey's injury is going to slow things down a bit for Carolina, but their offense isn't really the problem, it's their defense. They just don't really have any big playmakers on that side of the ball, so if they want to make the playoffs, I think they've got to pick up a defensive playmaker in free agency or via a trade.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>The Dolphins have been a bad team for a while now and I can't see this team making the playoffs. Defensively they're well coached by Brian Flores who was a former LB coach at New England, but offensively they're a bit inconsistent, and I think there is a way to change that. I think they should start rookie QB Tua as soon as he's medically okay to start, because I think he could give this team an energy that Fitzpatrick doesn't. The other rookie QBs, Burrow and Herbert, have had good starts to their pro careers, and Tua is arguably more talented than both of them, so I say get him starting as soon as possible.</p>

		  <div class="row">
		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>Fire Adam Gase. That's virtually the only answer to this question. The Jets have a good enough defense to compete in the AFC East, but Gase and Sam Darnold just don't work well as a Coach-QB duo, and in this situation, you have to get rid of the coach because it was the QB you drafted, not the coach. Darnold is definitely a better QB than we're seeing at the moment, and the Jets have some good offensive players like Crowder, Perriman, and Bell, although they are a bit hampered by injuries right now. For me though, it's really all about the need for a coaching change, because that can change the way a QB plays, which is what the Jets need right now - something different.</p>

		  	<div class="col">
		  		<p>You have to feel a bit for the Giants and Barkley after the former second overall pick is facing yet another lengthy sideline period with a torn ACL. He was really the spark for the Giants offense, someone who could make a big play when you needed one, so I don't give the Giants much of a chance to make the playoffs in 2020. If they want to at least be in with a shot, Daniel Jones definitely has to play better and that starts with establishing an elite chemistry with Evan Engram. There are so many dangerous QB-TE combinations in the league right now - Mahomes-Kelce, Jackson-Andrews, Carr-Waller. Unlocking a similar connection with Engram could open up a lot of things for the Giants. The one thing they have going for them is that they're in the worst division in football.</p>
